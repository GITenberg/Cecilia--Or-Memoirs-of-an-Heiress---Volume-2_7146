      CHAPTER x. &mdash; A MURMURING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Unable to relieve herself from this perplexity, Cecilia, to divert her
      chagrin, again visited Miss Belfield. She had then the pleasure to hear
      that her brother was much recovered, and had been able, the preceding day,
      to take an airing, which he had borne so well that Mr Rupil had charged
      him to use the same exercise every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will he?&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, I am sadly afraid not,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for coach hire is very
      expensive, and we are willing, now, to save all we can in order to help
      fitting him out for going abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then earnestly entreated her to accept some assistance; but she
      assured her she did not dare without the consent of her mother, which,
      however, she undertook to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, when Cecilia called to hear her success, Mrs Belfield, who
      hitherto had kept out of sight, made her appearance. She found her, alike
      in person, manners and conversation, a coarse and ordinary woman, not more
      unlike her son in talents and acquired accomplishments, than dissimilar to
      her daughter in softness and natural delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Cecilia was seated, she began, without waiting for any
      ceremony, or requiring any solicitation, abruptly to talk of her affairs,
      and repiningly to relate her misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find, madam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have been so kind as to visit my daughter
      Henny a great many times, but as I have no time for company, I have always
      kept out of the way, having other things to do than sit still to talk. I
      have had a sad time of it here, ma'am, with my poor son's illness, having
      no conveniencies about me, and much ado to make him mind me; for he's all
      for having his own way, poor dear soul, and I'm sure I don't know who
      could contradict him, for it's what I never had the heart to do. But then,
      ma'am, what is to come of it? You see how bad things go! for though I have
      got a very good income, it won't do for every thing. And if it was as much
      again, I should want to save it all now. For here my poor son, you see, is
      reduced all in a minute, as one may say, from being one of the first
      gentlemen in the town, to a mere poor object, without a farthing in the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, however, I hope now much better in his health?&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, thank heaven, for if he was worse, those might tell of it
      that would, for I'm sure I should never live to hear of it. He has been
      the best son in the world, madam, and used [to] nothing but the best
      company, for I spared neither pains nor cost to bring him up genteely, and
      I believe there's not a nobleman in the land that looks more the
      gentleman. However, there's come no good of it, for though his
      acquaintances was all among the first quality, he never received the value
      of a penny from the best of them. So I have no great need to be proud. But
      I meant for the best, though I have often enough wished I had not meddled
      in the matter, but left him to be brought up in the shop, as his father
      was before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His present plan, however,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;will I hope make you ample
      amends both for your sufferings and your tenderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, madam, when he's going to leave me, and settle in foreign parts? If
      you was a mother yourself, madam, you would not think that such good
      amends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settle?&rdquo; said Cecilia. &ldquo;No, he only goes for a year or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's more than I can say, madam, or any body else; and nobody knows
      what may happen in that time. And how I shall keep myself up when he's
      beyond seas, I am sure I don't know, for he has always been the pride of
      my life, and every penny I saved for him, I thought to have been paid in
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will still have your daughter, and she seems so amiable, that I am
      sure you can want no consolation she will not endeavour to give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is a daughter, madam, to such a son as mine? a son that I
      thought to have seen living like a prince, and sending his own coach for
      me to dine with him! And now he's going to be taken away from me, and
      nobody knows if I shall live till he comes back. But I may thank myself,
      for if I had but been content to see him brought up in the shop&mdash;yet
      all the world would have cried shame upon it, for when he was quite a
      child in arms, the people used all to say he was born to be a gentleman,
      and would live to make many a fine lady's heart ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he can but make <i>your</i> heart easy,&rdquo; said Cecilia, smiling, &ldquo;we
      will not grieve that the fine ladies should escape the prophecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ma'am, I don't mean by that to say he has been over gay among the
      ladies, for it's a thing I never heard of him; and I dare say if any lady
      was to take a fancy to him, she'd find there was not a modester young man
      in the world. But you must needs think what a hardship it is to me to have
      him turn out so unlucky, after all I have done for him, when I thought to
      have seen him at the top of the tree, as one may say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will yet, I hope,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;make you rejoice in all your
      kindness to him; his health is already returning, and his affairs wear
      again a more prosperous aspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you suppose, ma'am, that having him sent two or three hundred
      miles away from me; with some young master to take care of, is the way to
      make up to me what I have gone through for him? why I used to deny myself
      every thing in the world, in order to save money to buy him smart cloaths,
      and let him go to the Opera, and Ranelagh, and such sort of places, that
      he might keep himself in fortune's way! and now you see the end of it!
      here he is, in a little shabby room up two pairs of stairs, with not one
      of the great folks coming near him, to see if he's so much as dead or
      alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;that you resent their shewing so little
      gratitude for the pleasure and entertainment they have formerly received
      from him but comfort yourself that it will at least secure you from any
      similar disappointment, as Mr Belfield will, in future, be guarded from
      forming such precarious expectations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what good will that do me, ma'am, for all the money he has been
      throwing after them all this while? do you think I would have scraped it
      up for him, and gone without every thing in the world, to see it all end
      in this manner? why he might as well have been brought up the commonest
      journeyman, for any comfort I shall have of him at this rate. And suppose
      he should be drowned in going beyond seas? what am I to do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;indulge such fears; I doubt not but your
      son will return well, and return all that you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows that, ma'am; and the only way to be certain is for him not
      to go at all; and I'm surprised, ma'am, you can wish him to make such a
      journey to nobody knows where, with nothing but a young master that he
      must as good as teach his A. B. C. all the way they go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cecilia, amazed at this accusation, &ldquo;I should not wish
      him to go abroad, if any thing more eligible could be, done by his
      remaining in England but as no prospect of that sort seems before him, you
      must endeavour to reconcile yourself to parting with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but how am I to do that, when I don't know if ever I shall see him
      again? Who could have thought of his living so among the great folks, and
      then coming to want! I'm sure I thought they'd have provided for him like
      a son of their own, for he used to go about to all the public places just
      as they did themselves. Day after day I used to be counting for when he
      would come to tell me he'd got a place at court, or something of that
      sort, for I never could tell what it would be; and then the next news I
      heard, was that he was shut up in this poor bit of place, with nobody
      troubling their heads about him! however, I'll never be persuaded but he
      might have done better, if he would but have spoke a good word for
      himself, or else have let me done it for him; instead of which, he never
      would so much as let me see any of his grand friends, though I would not
      have made the least scruple in the world to have asked them for any thing
      he had a mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia again endeavoured to give her comfort; but finding her only
      satisfaction was to express her discontent, she arose to take leave. But,
      turning first to Miss Belfield, contrived to make a private enquiry
      whether she might repeat her offer of assistance. A downcast and dejected
      look answering in the affirmative, she put into her hand a ten pound bank
      note, and wishing them good morning, hurried out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Belfield was running after her, but stopt by her mother, who called
      out, &ldquo;What is it?&mdash;How much is it?&mdash;Let me look at it!&rdquo;&mdash;And
      then, following Cecilia herself, she thanked her aloud all the way down
      stairs for her <i>genteelness</i>, assuring her she would not fail making
      it known to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia at this declaration turned back, and exhorted her by no means to
      mention it; after which she got into her chair, and returned home; pitying
      Miss Belfield for the unjust partiality shewn to her brother, and excusing
      the proud shame he had manifested of his relations, from the vulgarity and
      selfishness of her who was at the head of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost a fortnight had now elapsed since her explanation with young
      Delvile, yet not once had he been in Portman-square, though in the
      fortnight which had preceded, scarce a day had passed which had not
      afforded him some pretence for calling there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a note arrived from Mrs Delvile. It contained the most
      flattering reproaches for her long absence, and a pressing invitation that
      she would dine and spend the next day with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who had merely denied herself the pleasure of this visit from an
      apprehension of seeming too desirous of keeping up the connection, now,
      from the same sense of propriety, determined upon making it, wishing
      equally to avoid all appearance of consciousness, either by seeking or
      avoiding the intimacy of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a little was her anxiety to know in what manner young Delvile would
      receive her, whether he would be grave or gay, agitated, as during their
      last conversation, or easy, as in the meetings which had preceded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Mrs Delvile, however, alone; and, extremely kind to her, yet
      much surprised, and half displeased, that she had so long been absent.
      Cecilia, though somewhat distressed what excuses to offer, was happy to
      find herself so highly in favour, and not very reluctant to promise more
      frequent visits in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were then summoned to dinner; but still no young Delvile was visible;
      they were joined only by his father, and she found that no one else was
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her astonishment now was greater than ever, and she could account by no
      possible conjecture for a conduct so extraordinary. Hitherto, whenever she
      had visited in St James's-square by appointment, the air with which he had
      received her, constantly announced that he had impatiently waited her
      arrival; he had given up other engagements to stay with her, he had openly
      expressed his hopes that she would never be long absent, and seemed to
      take a pleasure in her society to which every other was inferior. And now,
      how striking the difference! he forbore all visits at the house where she
      resided, he even flew from his own when he knew she was approaching it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this the only vexation of which this day was productive; Mr
      Delvile, when the servants were withdrawn after dinner, expressed some
      concern that he had been called from her during their last conversation,
      and added that he would take the present opportunity to talk with her upon
      some matters of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then began the usual parading prelude, which, upon all occasions, he
      thought necessary, in order to enhance the value of his interposition,
      remind her of her inferiority, and impress her with a deeper sense of the
      honour which his guardianship conferred upon her after which, he proceeded
      to make a formal enquiry whether she had positively dismissed Sir Robert
      Floyer?
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured him she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood my Lord Ernolf,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you had totally discouraged
      the addresses of his son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;for I never mean to receive them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, any other engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; cried she, colouring between shame and displeasure, &ldquo;none at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very extraordinary circumstance!&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;the son of an
      earl to be rejected by a young woman of no family, and yet no reason
      assigned for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This contemptuous speech so cruelly shocked Cecilia, that though he
      continued to harangue her for a great part of the afternoon, she only
      answered him when compelled by some question, and was so evidently
      discomposed, that Mrs Delvile, who perceived her uneasiness with much
      concern, redoubled her civilities and caresses, and used every method in
      her power to oblige and enliven her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was not ungrateful for her care, and shewed her sense of it by
      added respect and attention; but her mind was disturbed, and she quitted
      the house as soon as she was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile's speech, from her previous knowledge of the extreme
      haughtiness of his character, would not have occasioned her the smallest
      emotion, had it merely related to him or to herself; but as it concerned
      Lord Ernolf, she regarded it as also concerning his son, and she found
      that, far from trying to promote the union Mr Monckton had told her he had
      planned, he did not seem even to think of it, but, on the contrary,
      proposed and seconded with all his interest another alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, added to the behaviour of young Delvile, made her suspect that some
      engagement was in agitation on his own part, and that while she thought
      him so sedulous only to avoid her, he was simply occupied in seeking
      another. This painful suggestion, which every thing seemed to confirm,
      again overset all her schemes, and destroyed all her visionary happiness.
      Yet how to reconcile it with what had passed at their last meeting she
      knew not; she had then every reason to believe that his heart was in her
      power, and that courage, or an opportunity more seasonable, was all he
      wanted to make known his devotion to her; why, then, shun if he loved her?
      why, if he loved her not, seem so perturbed at the explanation of her
      independence?
    </p>
    <p>
      A very little time, however, she hoped would unravel this mystery; in two
      days, the entertainment which Mr Harrel had planned, to deceive the world
      by an appearance of affluence to which he had lost all title, was to take
      place; young Delvile, in common with every other person who had ever been
      seen at the house, had early received an invitation, which he had readily
      promised to accept some time before the conversation that seemed the
      period of their acquaintance had passed. Should he, after being so long
      engaged, fail to keep his appointment, she could no longer have any doubt
      of the justice of her conjecture; should he, on the contrary, again
      appear, from his behaviour and his looks she might perhaps be able to
      gather why he had so long been absent.

      CHAPTER i. &mdash; A ROUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day at length arrived of which the evening and the entrance of company
      were, for the first time, as eagerly wished by Cecilia as by her
      dissipated host and hostess. No expence and no pains had been spared to
      render this long projected entertainment splendid and elegant; it was to
      begin with a concert, which was to be followed by a ball, and succeeded by
      a supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though unusually anxious about her own affairs, was not so
      engrossed by them as to behold with indifference a scene of such
      unjustifiable extravagance; it contributed to render her thoughtful and
      uneasy, and to deprive her of all mental power of participating in the
      gaiety of the assembly. Mr Arnott was yet more deeply affected by the mad
      folly of the scheme, and received from the whole evening no other
      satisfaction than that which a look of sympathetic concern from Cecilia
      occasionally afforded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till nine o'clock no company appeared, except Sir Robert Floyer, who
      stayed from dinner time, and Mr Morrice, who having received an invitation
      for the evening, was so much delighted with the permission to again enter
      the house, that he made use of it between six and seven o'clock, and
      before the family had left the dining parlour. He apologized with the
      utmost humility to Cecilia for the unfortunate accident at the Pantheon;
      but as to her it had been productive of nothing but pleasure, by exciting
      in young Delvile the most flattering alarm for her safety, she found no
      great difficulty in according him her pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who came in the first crowd was Mr Monckton, who, had he been
      equally unconscious of sinister views, would in following his own
      inclination, have been as early in his attendance as Mr Morrice; but who,
      to obviate all suspicious remarks, conformed to the fashionable tardiness
      of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's chief apprehension for the evening was that Sir Robert Floyer
      would ask her to dance with him, which she could not refuse without
      sitting still during the ball, nor accept, after the reports she knew to
      be spread, without seeming to give a public sanction to them. To Mr
      Monckton therefore, innocently considering him as a married man and her
      old friend, she frankly told her distress, adding, by way of excuse for
      the hint, that the partners were to be changed every two dances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton, though his principal study was carefully to avoid all public
      gallantry or assiduity towards Cecilia, had not the forbearance to resist
      this intimation, and therefore she had the pleasure of telling Sir Robert,
      when he asked the honour of her hand for the two first dances, that she
      was already engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then expected that he would immediately secure her for the two
      following; but, to her great joy, he was so much piqued by the evident
      pleasure with which she announced her engagement, that he proudly walked
      away without adding another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much satisfied with this arrangement, and not without hopes that, if she
      was at liberty when he arrived, she might be applied to by young Delvile,
      she now endeavoured to procure herself a place in the music room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, with some difficulty, she effected; but though there was an
      excellent concert, in which several capital performers played and sung,
      she found it impossible to hear a note, as she chanced to be seated just
      by Miss Leeson, and two other young ladies, who were paying one another
      compliments upon their dress and their looks, settling to dance in the
      same cotillon, guessing who would begin the minuets, and wondering there
      were not more gentlemen. Yet, in the midst of this unmeaning conversation,
      of which she remarked that Miss Leeson bore the principal part, not one of
      them failed, from time to time, to exclaim with great rapture <i>&ldquo;What
      sweet music!&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! how charming!&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you ever hear any thing so
      delightful?&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Cecilia to Mr Gosport, who now approached her, &ldquo;but for your
      explanatory observations, how much would the sudden loquacity of this
      supercilious lady, whom I had imagined all but dumb, have perplext me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who are most silent to strangers,&rdquo; answered Mr Gosport, &ldquo;commonly
      talk most fluently to their intimates, for they are deeply in arrears, and
      eager to pay off their debts. Miss Leeson now is in her proper set, and
      therefore appears in her natural character; and the poor girl's joy in
      being able to utter all the nothings she has painfully hoarded while
      separated from her coterie, gives to her now the wild transport of a bird
      just let loose from a cage. I rejoice to see the little creature at
      liberty, for what can be so melancholy as a forced appearance of thinking,
      where there are no materials for such an occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, Miss Larolles, who was laughing immoderately, contrived to
      crowd herself into their party, calling out to them, &ldquo;O you have had the
      greatest loss in the world! if you had but been in the next room just now!&mdash;there's
      the drollest figure there you can conceive; enough to frighten one to look
      at him.&rdquo; And presently she added &ldquo;O Lord, if you stoop a little this way,
      you may see him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a general tittering, accompanied with exclamations of &ldquo;Lord,
      what a fright!&rdquo; &ldquo;It's enough to kill one with laughing to look at him!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Did you ever see such a horrid creature in your life?&rdquo; And soon after,
      one of them screamed out &ldquo;O Lord, see!&mdash;he's grinning at Miss
      Beverley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then turned her head towards the door, and there, to her own as
      well as her neighbours' amazement, she perceived Mr Briggs! who, in order
      to look about him at his ease, was standing upon a chair, from which,
      having singled her out, he was regarding her with a facetious smirk,
      which, when it caught her eye, was converted into a familiar nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned his salutation, but was not much charmed to observe, that
      presently descending from his exalted post, which had moved the wonder and
      risibility of all the company, he made a motion to approach her; for which
      purpose, regardless of either ladies or gentlemen in his way, he sturdily
      pushed forward, with the same unconcerned hardiness he would have forced
      himself through a crowd in the street; and taking not the smallest notice
      of their frowns, supplications that he would stand still, and exclamations
      of &ldquo;Pray, Sir!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, how troublesome!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sir, I do assure you
      here's no room!&rdquo; he fairly and adroitly elbowed them from him till he
      reached her seat; and then, with a waggish grin, he looked round, to show
      he had got the better, and to see whom he had discomposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had enjoyed this triumph, he turned to Cecilia, and chucking her
      under the chin, said &ldquo;Well, my little duck, how goes it? got to you at
      last; squeezed my way; would not be nicked; warrant I'll mob with the best
      of them! Look here! all in a heat!&mdash;hot as the dog days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, to the utter consternation of the company, he took off his wig
      to wipe his head! which occasioned such universal horror, that all who
      were near the door escaped into other, apartments, while those who were
      too much enclosed, for flight, with one accord turned away their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Aresby, being applied to by some of the ladies to remonstrate upon
      this unexampled behaviour, advanced to him, and said, &ldquo;I am quite <i>abimé</i>,
      Sir, to incommode you, but the commands of the ladies are insuperable.
      Give me leave, Sir, to entreat that you would put on your wig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wig?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;ay, ay, shall in a moment, only want to wipe my head
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite <i>assommé</i>, Sir,&rdquo; returned the Captain, &ldquo;to disturb you,
      but I must really hint you don't comprehend me; the ladies are extremely
      inconvenienced by these sort of sights, and we make it a principle they
      should never be <i>accablées</i> with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anan!&rdquo; cried Mr Briggs, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Sir,&rdquo; replied the Captain, &ldquo;the ladies are quite <i>au desespoir</i>
      that you will not cover your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;what's the matter with my head? ne'er a man here
      got a better! very good stuff in it; won't change it with ne'er a one of
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, half unconscious of the offence he had given, and half angry at
      the rebuke he had received, he leisurely compleated his design, and again
      put on his wig, settling it to his face with as much composure as if he
      had performed the operation in his own dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, having gained his point, walked away, making, however,
      various grimaces of disgust, and whispering from side to side &ldquo;he's the
      most petrifying fellow I ever was <i>obsedé</i> by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Briggs then, with much derision, and sundry distortions of countenance,
      listened to an Italian song; after which, he bustled back to the outer
      apartment, in search of Cecilia, who, ashamed of seeming a party in the
      disturbance he had excited, had taken the opportunity of his dispute with
      the Captain, to run into the next room; where, however, he presently found
      her, while she was giving an account to Mr Gosport of her connection with
      him, to which Morrice, ever curious and eager to know what was going
      forward, was also listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, little chick!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;got to you again! soon out jostle those
      jemmy sparks! But where's the supper? see nothing of the supper! Time to
      go to bed,&mdash;suppose there is none; all a take in; nothing but a
      little piping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper, Sir?&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;the Concert is not over yet. Was supper
      mentioned in your card of invitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to be sure, should not have come else. Don't visit often; always
      costs money. Wish I had not come now; wore a hole in my shoe; hardly a
      crack in it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you did not walk, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, did; why not? Might as well have stayed away though; daubed my best
      coat, like to have spoilt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for the taylors, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, pertly, &ldquo;for then
      you must have another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another! what for? ha'n't had this seven years; just as good as new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;you had not another fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, worse; like to have lost my bundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What bundle, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best coat and waistcoat; brought 'em in my handkerchief, purpose to save
      them. When will Master Harrel do as much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But had you no apprehensions, Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport drily, &ldquo;that the
      handkerchief would be the sooner worn out for having a knot tied in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took care of that, tied it slack. Met an unlucky boy; little dog gave it
      a pluck; knot slipt; coat and waistcoat popt out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what became of the boy, Sir?&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;I hope he got off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not run for laughing; caught him in a minute; gave him something to
      laugh for; drubbed him soundly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O poor fellow!&rdquo; cried Morrice with a loud hallow, &ldquo;I am really sorry for
      him. But pray, Sir, what became of your best coat and waistcoat while you
      gave him this drubbing? did you leave them in the dirt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr Nincompoop,&rdquo; answered Briggs angrily, &ldquo;I put them on a stall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a perilous expedient, Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;and I should fear
      might be attended with ill consequences, for the owner of the stall would
      be apt to expect some little <i>douçeur</i>. How did you manage, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bought a halfpenny worth of apples. Serve for supper to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how, Sir, did you get your cloaths dried, or cleaned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went to an alehouse; cost me half a pint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Sir,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;where, at last, did you make your
      toilette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sha'n't tell, sha'n't tell; ask no more questions. What signifies where a
      man slips on a coat and waist-coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir, this will prove an expensive expedition to you,&rdquo; said Mr
      Gosport, very gravely; &ldquo;Have you cast up what it may cost you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than it's worth, more than it's worth,&rdquo; answered he pettishly
      &ldquo;ha'n't laid out so much in pleasure these five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried Morrice, hallowing aloud, &ldquo;why it can't be more than
      sixpence in all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixpence?&rdquo; repeated he scornfully, &ldquo;if you don't know the value of
      sixpence, you'll never be worth fivepence three farthings. How do think
      got rich, hay?&mdash;by wearing fine coats, and frizzling my pate? No, no;
      Master Harrel for that! ask him if he'll cast an account with me!&mdash;never
      knew a man worth a penny with such a coat as that on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrice again laughed, and again Mr Briggs reproved him; and Cecilia,
      taking advantage of the squabble, stole back to the music-room. Here, in a
      few minutes, Mrs Panton, a lady who frequently visited at the house,
      approached Cecilia, followed by a gentleman, whom she had never before
      seen, but who was so evidently charmed with her, that he had looked at no
      other object since his entrance into the house. Mrs Panton, presenting him
      to her by the name of Mr Marriot, told her he had begged her intercession
      for the honour of her hand in the two first dances; and the moment she
      answered that she was already engaged, the same request was made for the
      two following. Cecilia had then no excuse, and was therefore obliged to
      accept him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope she had entertained in the early part of the evening, was already
      almost wholly extinguished; Delvile appeared not! though her eye watched
      the entrance of every new visitor, and her vexation made her believe that
      he alone, of all the town, was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Concert was over, the company joined promiscuously for chat and
      refreshments before the ball; and Mr Gosport advanced to Cecilia, to
      relate a ridiculous dispute which had just passed between Mr Briggs and
      Morrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Mr Gosport,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;who seem to make the <i>minutiae</i> of
      absurd characters your study, can explain to me, perhaps, why Mr Briggs
      seems to have as much pleasure in proclaiming his meanness, as in boasting
      his wealth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Mr Gosport, &ldquo;he knows them, in his own affairs, to be
      so nearly allied, that but for practising the one, he had never possessed
      the other; ignorant, therefore, of all discrimination,&mdash;except,
      indeed, of pounds, shillings and pence!&mdash;he supposes them necessarily
      inseparable, because with him they were united. What you, however, call
      meanness, he thinks wisdom, and recollects, therefore, not with shame but
      with triumph, the various little arts and subterfuges by which his coffers
      have been filled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Lord Ernolf, concluding Cecilia still disengaged from seeing her only
      discourse with Mr Gosport and Mr Monckton, one of them was old enough
      to be her father, and the other was a <i>married man</i>, advanced, and
      presenting to her Lord Derford, his son, a youth not yet of age, solicited
      for him the honour of her hand as his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, having a double excuse, easily declined this proposal; Lord
      Ernolf, however, was too earnest to be repulsed, and told her he should
      again try his interest when her two present engagements were fulfilled.
      Hopeless, now, of young Delvile, she heard this intimation with
      indifference; and was accompanying Mr Monckton into the ballroom, when
      Miss Larolles, flying towards her with an air of infinite eagerness,
      caught her hand, and said in a whisper &ldquo;pray let me wish you joy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;but pray let me ask you of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, now,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;I am sure you know what I mean; but you must
      know I have a prodigious monstrous great favour to beg of you; now pray
      don't refuse me; I assure you if you do, I shall be so mortified you've no
      notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but to let me be one of your bride maids. I assure you I shall
      take it as the greatest favour in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bride maid!&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;but do you not think the bridegroom
      himself will be rather offended to find a bridesmaid appointed, before he
      is even thought of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O pray, now,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;don't be ill-natured, for if you are, you've no
      idea how I shall be disappointed. Only conceive what happened to me three
      weeks ago! you must know I was invited to Miss Clinton's wedding, and so I
      made up a new dress on purpose, in a very particular sort of shape, quite
      of my own invention, and it had the sweetest effect you can conceive;
      well, and when the time came, do you know her mother happened to die!
      Never any thing was so excessive unlucky, for now she won't be married
      this half year, and my dress will be quite old and yellow; for it's all
      white, and the most beautiful thing you ever saw in your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word you are very obliging!&rdquo; cried Cecilia laughing; &ldquo;and pray do
      you make interest regularly round with all your female acquaintance to be
      married upon this occasion, or am I the only one you think this distress
      will work upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now how excessive teazing!&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;when you know so well
      what I mean, and when all the town knows as well as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then seriously enquired whether she had really any meaning at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord yes,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;you know I mean about Sir Robert Floyer; for
      I'm told you've quite refused Lord Derford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you also told that I have accepted Sir Robert Floyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear yes!&mdash;the jewels are bought, and the equipages are built;
      it's quite a settled thing, I know very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then very gravely began an attempt to undeceive her; but the
      dancing beginning also at the same time, she stayed not to hear her,
      hurrying, with a beating heart, to the place of action. Mr Monckton and
      his fair partner then followed, mutually exclaiming against Mr Harrel's
      impenetrable conduct; of which Cecilia, however, in a short time ceased
      wholly to think, for as soon as the first cotillon was over, she perceived
      young Delvile just walking into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise, pleasure and confusion assailed her all at once; she had
      entirely given up her expectation of seeing him, and an absence so
      determined had led her to conclude he had pursuits which ought to make her
      join in wishing it lengthened; but now he appeared, that conclusion, with
      the fears that gave rise to it, vanished; and she regretted nothing but
      the unfortunate succession of engagements which would prevent her dancing
      with him at all, and probably keep off all conversation with him till
      supper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon, however, perceived a change in his air and behaviour that
      extremely astonished her; he looked grave and thoughtful, saluted her at a
      distance, shewed no sign of any intention to approach her, regarded the
      dancing and dancers as a public spectacle in which he had no chance of
      personal interest, and seemed wholly altered, not merely with respect to
      her, but to himself, as his former eagerness for her society was not more
      abated than [his] former general gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no time, however, for comments, as she was presently called to the
      second cotillon; but the confused and unpleasant ideas which, without
      waiting for time or reflection, crowded upon her imagination on observing
      his behaviour, were not more depressing to herself, than obvious to her
      partner; Mr Monckton by the change in her countenance first perceived the
      entrance of young Delvile, and by her apparent emotion and uneasiness,
      readily penetrated into the state of her mind; he was confirmed that her
      affections were engaged; he saw, too, that she was doubtful with what
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grief with which he made the first discovery, was somewhat lessened by
      the hopes he conceived from, the second; yet the evening was to him as
      painful as to Cecilia, since he now knew that whatever prosperity' might
      ultimately attend his address and assiduity, her heart was not her own to
      bestow; and that even were he sure of young Delvile's indifference, and
      actually at liberty to make proposals for himself, the time of being first
      in her esteem was at an end, and the long-earned good opinion which he had
      hoped would have ripened into affection, might now be wholly undermined by
      the sudden impression of a lively stranger, without trouble to himself,
      and perhaps without pleasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflections such as these wholly embittered the delight he had promised
      himself from dancing with her, and took from him all power to combat the
      anxiety with which she was seized; when the second cotillon, therefore,
      was over, instead of following her to a seat, or taking the privilege of
      his present situation to converse with her, the jealousy rising in his
      breast robbed him of all satisfaction, and gave to him no other desire
      than to judge its justice by watching her motions at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mean while Cecilia, inattentive whether he accompanied or quitted her
      proceeded to the first vacant seat. Young Delvile was standing near it,
      and, in a short time, but rather as if he could not avoid than as if he
      wished it, he came to enquire how she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest question, in the then situation of her mind, was sufficient
      to confuse her, and though she answered, she hardly knew what he had
      asked. A minute's recollection, however, restored an apparent composure,
      and she talked to him of Mrs Delvile, with her usual partial regard for
      that lady, and with an earnest endeavour to seem unconscious of any
      alteration in his behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, to him, even this trifling and general conversation was evidently
      painful, and he looked relieved by the approach of Sir Robert Floyer, who
      soon after joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time a young lady who was sitting by Cecilia, called to a servant
      who was passing, for a glass of lemonade; Cecilia desired he would bring
      her one also; but Delvile, not sorry to break off the discourse, said he
      would himself be her cup-bearer, and for that purpose went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment after, the servant returned with some lemonade to Cecilia's
      neighbour, and Sir Robert, taking a glass from him, brought it to Cecilia
      at the very instant young Delvile came with another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am before hand with you, Sir,&rdquo; said the insolent Baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; answered young Delvile, &ldquo;I think we were both in together; Miss
      Beverley, however, is steward of the race, and we must submit to her
      decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam,&rdquo; cried Sir Robert, &ldquo;here we stand, waiting your pleasure.
      Which is to be the happy man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each, I hope,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, with admirable presence of mind, &ldquo;since
      I expect no less than that you will both do me the honour of drinking my
      health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little contrivance, which saved her alike from shewing favour or
      giving offence, could not but be applauded by both parties; and while they
      obeyed her orders, she took a third glass herself from the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Mr Briggs, again perceiving her, stumpt hastily
      towards her, calling out &ldquo;Ah ha! my duck! what's that? got something nice?
      Come here, my lad, taste it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then took a glass, but having only put it to his mouth, made a wry
      face, and returned it, saying &ldquo;Bad! bad! poor punch indeed!&mdash;not a
      drop of rum in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, Sir,&rdquo; cried Morrice, who diverted himself by
      following him, &ldquo;for then you see the master of the house spares in
      something, and you said he spared in nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't spare in fools!&rdquo; returned Mr Briggs, &ldquo;keeps them in plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir, nor in any out of the way characters,&rdquo; answered Morrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse,&rdquo; cried Briggs, &ldquo;so much the worse! Eat him out of
      house and home; won't leave him a rag to his back nor a penny in his
      pocket. Never mind 'em, my little duck; mind none of your guardians but
      me; t'other two a'n't worth a rush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, somewhat ashamed of this speech, looked towards young Delvile, in
      whom it occasioned the first smile she had seen that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been looking about for you!&rdquo; continued Briggs, nodding sagaciously;
      &ldquo;believe I've found one will do. Guess what I mean;&mdash;£100,0000&mdash;hay?&mdash;what
      say to that? any thing better at the west end of the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;£100,000!&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;and pray, Sir, who may this be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you, Mr jackanapes! sure of that. A'n't quite positive he'll have
      you, neither. Think he will, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray; Sir, what age is he?&rdquo; cried the never daunted Morrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why about&mdash;let's see&mdash;don't know, never heard,&mdash;what
      signifies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sir, he's an old man, I suppose, by being so rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old? no, no such thing; about my own standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Sir, and do you propose him for an husband to Miss Beverley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? know ever a one warmer? think Master Harrel will get her a
      better? or t'other old Don, in the grand square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia hastily, &ldquo;we will talk of this matter
      another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, pray,&rdquo; cried young Delvile, who could not forbear laughing, &ldquo;let it
      be discussed now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hate 'em,&rdquo; continued Mr Briggs, &ldquo;hate 'em both! one spending more than
      he's worth, cheated and over-reached by fools, running into gaol to please
      a parcel of knaves; t'other counting nothing but uncles and grandfathers,
      dealing out fine names instead of cash, casting up more cousins than
      guineas&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Cecilia endeavoured to silence him, but, only chucking her under the
      chin, he went on, &ldquo;Ay, ay, my little duck, never mind 'em; one of 'em
      i'n't worth a penny, and t'other has nothing in his pockets but lists of
      the defunct. What good will come of that? would not give twopence a dozen
      for 'em! A poor set of grandees, with nothing but a tie-wig for their
      portions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, unable to bear this harangue in the presence of young Delvile,
      who, however, laughed it off with a very good grace, arose with an
      intention to retreat, which being perceived by Sir Robert Floyer, who had
      attended to this dialogue with haughty contempt, he came forward, and
      said, &ldquo;now then, madam, may I have the honour of your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;I am engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged again?&rdquo; cried he, with the air of a man who thought himself much
      injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of it, glad of it!&rdquo; said Mr Briggs; &ldquo;served very right! have nothing
      to say to him, my chick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Sir?&rdquo; cried Sir Robert, with an imperious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sha'n't have her, sha'n't have her! can tell you that; won't consent;
      know you of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you know of me, pray Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good, no good; nothing to say to you; found fault with my nose! ha'n't
      forgot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr Marriot came to claim his partner, who, very willing to
      quit this scene of wrangling and vulgarity, immediately attended him. Miss
      Larolles, again flying up to her, said &ldquo;O my dear, we are all expiring to
      know who that creature is! I never saw such a horrid fright in my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was beginning to satisfy her, but some more young ladies coming up
      to join in the request, she endeavoured to pass on; &ldquo;O but,&rdquo; cried Miss
      Larolles, detaining her, &ldquo;do pray stop, for I've something to tell you
      that's so monstrous you've no idea. Do you know Mr Meadows has not danced
      at all! and he's been standing with Mr Sawyer, and looking on all the
      time, and whispering and laughing so you've no notion. However, I assure
      you, I'm excessive glad he did not ask me, for all I have been sitting
      still all this time, for I had a great deal rather sit still, I assure
      you; only I'm sorry I put on this dress, for any thing would have done
      just to look on in that stupid manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Meadows sauntered towards them; and all the young ladies began
      playing with their fans, and turning their heads another way, to disguise
      the expectations his approach awakened; and Miss Larolles, in a hasty
      whisper to Cecilia, cried, &ldquo;Pray don't take any notice of what I said, for
      if he should happen to ask me, I can't well refuse him, you know, for if I
      do, he'll be so excessive affronted you can't think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows then, mixing in the little group, began, with sundry grimaces,
      to exclaim &ldquo;how intolerably hot it is! there's no such thing as breathing.
      How can anybody think of dancing! I am amazed Mr Harrel has not a
      ventilator in this room. Don't you think it would be a great improvement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, though particularly addressed to no one, received immediately
      an assenting answer from all the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Miss Larolles, &ldquo;Don't you dance?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; cried she, embarrassed, &ldquo;yes, I believe so,&mdash;really I don't
      know,&mdash;I a'n't quite determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, do dance!&rdquo; cried he, stretching himself and yawning, &ldquo;it always gives
      me spirits to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning suddenly to Cecilia, without any previous ceremony of
      renewing his acquaintance, either by speaking or bowing, he abruptly said
      &ldquo;Do you love dancing, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir, extremely well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad to hear it. You have one thing, then, to soften existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dislike it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dancing? Oh dreadful! how it was ever adopted in a civilized country
      I cannot find out; 'tis certainly a Barbarian exercise, and of savage
      origin. Don't you think so, Miss Larolles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord no,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;I assure you I like it better than any
      thing; I know nothing so delightful, I declare I dare say I could not live
      without it; I should be so stupid you can't conceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I remember,&rdquo; said Mr Marriot, &ldquo;when Mr Meadows was always dancing
      himself. Have you forgot, Sir, when you used to wish the night would last
      for ever, that you might dance without ceasing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, who was now intently surveying a painting that was over the
      chimney-piece, seemed not to hear this question, but presently called out
      &ldquo;I am amazed Mr Harrel can suffer such a picture as this to be in his
      house. I hate a portrait, 'tis so wearisome looking at a thing that is
      doing nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like historical pictures, Sir, any better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, I detest them! views of battles, murders, and death! Shocking!
      shocking!&mdash;I shrink from them with horror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are fond of landscapes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means! Green trees and fat cows! what do they tell one? I hate
      every thing that is insipid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your toleration, then,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;will not be very extensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, yawning, &ldquo;one can tolerate nothing! one's patience is
      wholly exhausted by the total tediousness of every thing one sees, and
      every body one talks with. Don't you find it so, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sometimes</i>!&rdquo; said Cecilia, rather archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, ma'am, extremely right; one does not know what in the
      world to do with one's self. At home, one is killed with meditation,
      abroad, one is overpowered by ceremony; no possibility of finding ease or
      comfort. You never go into public, I think, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not to be much <i>marked</i>, I find!&rdquo; said Cecilia, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I beg your pardon! I believe I saw you one evening at Almack's; I
      really beg your pardon, but I had quite forgot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Mr Meadows,&rdquo; said Miss Larolles, &ldquo;don't you know you are meaning
      the Pantheon? only conceive how you forget things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pantheon, was it? I never know one of those places from another. I
      heartily wish they were all abolished; I hate public places. 'Tis terrible
      to be under the same roof with a set of people who would care nothing if
      they saw one expiring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, at least, then, fond of the society of your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no! to be worn out by seeing always the same faces!&mdash;one is sick
      to death of friends; nothing makes one so melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now went to join the dancers, and Mr Meadows, turning to Miss
      Larolles, said, &ldquo;Pray don't let me keep you from dancing; I am afraid
      you'll lose your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried she, bridling, &ldquo;I sha'n't dance at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How cruel!&rdquo; cried he, yawning, &ldquo;when you know how it exhilarates me to
      see you! Don't you think this room is very close? I must go and try
      another atmosphere,&mdash;But I hope you will relent, and dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, stretching his arms as if half asleep, he sauntered into the
      next room, where he flung himself upon a sofa till the ball was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new partner of Cecilia, who was a wealthy, but very simple young man,
      used his utmost efforts to entertain and oblige her, and, flattered by the
      warmth of his own desire, he fancied that he succeeded; though, in a state
      of such suspence and anxiety, a man of brighter talents had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the two dances, Lord Ernolf again attempted to engage her
      for his son, but she now excused herself from dancing any more, and sat
      quietly as a spectatress till the rest of the company gave over. Mr
      Marriot, however, would not quit her, and she was compelled to support
      with him a trifling conversation, which, though irksome to herself, to
      him, who had not <i>seen her in her happier hour</i>, was delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She expected every instant to be again joined by young Delvile, but the
      expectation was disappointed; he came not; she concluded he was in another
      apartment; the company was summoned to supper, she then thought it
      impossible to miss him; but, after waiting and looking for him in vain,
      she found he had already left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the evening she scarce knew what passed, for she attended to
      nothing; Mr Monckton might watch, and Mr Briggs might exhort her, Sir
      Robert might display his insolence, or Mr Marriot his gallantry,&mdash;all
      was equally indifferent, and equally unheeded; and before half the company
      left the house, she retired to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent the night in the utmost disturbance; the occurrences of the
      evening with respect to young Delvile she looked upon as decisive; if his
      absence had chagrined her, his presence had still more shocked her, since,
      while she was left to conjecture, though she had fears she had hopes, and
      though all she saw was gloomy, all she expected was pleasant; but they had
      now met, and those expectations proved fallacious. She knew not, indeed,
      how to account for the strangeness of his conduct; but in seeing it was
      strange, she was convinced it was unfavourable; he had evidently avoided
      her while it was in his power, and when, at last, he was obliged to meet
      her, he was formal, distant, and reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more she recollected and dwelt upon the difference of his behaviour in
      their preceding meeting, the more angry as well as amazed she became at
      the change, and though she still concluded the pursuit of some other
      object occasioned it, she could find no excuse for his fickleness if that
      pursuit was recent, nor for his caprice if it was anterior.

      CHAPTER ii. &mdash; A BROAD HINT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Cecilia, to drive Delvile a little from her thoughts, which
      she now no longer wished him to occupy, again made a visit to Miss
      Belfield, whose society afforded her more consolation than any other she
      could procure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her employed in packing up, and preparing to remove to another
      lodging, for her brother, she said, was so much better, that he did not
      think it right to continue in so disgraceful a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked with her accustomed openness of her affairs, and the interest
      which Cecilia involuntarily took in them, contributed to lessen her
      vexation in thinking of her own. &ldquo;The generous friend of my brother,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;who, though but a new acquaintance to him, has courted him in all
      his sorrows, when every body else forsook him, has brought him at last
      into a better way of thinking. He says there is a gentleman whose son is
      soon going abroad, who he is almost sure will like my brother vastly, and
      in another week, he is to be introduced to him. And so, if my mother can
      but reconcile herself to parting with him, perhaps we may all do well
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;when he is gone, will better know the value
      of the blessing she has left in her daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, madam, no; she is wrapt up in him, and cares nothing for all the
      world besides. It was always so, and we have all of us been used to it.
      But we have had a sad scene since you were so kind as to come last; for
      when she told him what you had done, he was almost out of his senses with
      anger that we had acquainted you with his distress, and he said it was
      publishing his misery, and undoing whatever his friend or himself could
      do, for it was making him ashamed to appear in the world, even when his
      affairs might be better. But I told him again and again that you had as
      much sweetness as goodness, and instead of hurting his reputation, would
      do him nothing but credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;Mrs Belfield mentioned the circumstance at
      all; it would have been better, for many reasons, that he should not have
      heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hoped it would please him,&rdquo; answered Miss Belfield, &ldquo;however, he made
      us both promise we would take no such step in future, for he said we were
      not reduced to so much indigence, whatever he was; and that as to our
      accepting money from other people, that we might save up our own for him,
      it would be answering no purpose, for he should think himself a monster to
      make use of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what said your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why she gave him a great many promises that she would never vex him about
      it again; and indeed, much as I know we are obliged to you, madam, and
      gratefully as I am sure I would lay down my life to serve you, I am very
      glad in this case that my brother has found it out. For though I so much
      wish him to do something for himself, and not to be so proud, and live in
      a manner he has no right to do, I think, for all that, that it is a great
      disgrace to my' poor father's honest memory, to have us turn beggars after
      his death, when he left us all so well provided for, if we had but known
      how to be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a natural rectitude in your heart,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;that the
      ablest casuists could not mend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then enquired whither they were removing, and Miss Belfield told her
      to Portland Street, Oxford Road, where they were to have two apartments up
      two pair of stairs, and the use of a very good parlour, in which her
      brother might see his friends. &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;is a luxury for
      which nobody can blame him, because if he has not the appearance of a
      decent home, no gentleman will employ him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Padington house, she said, was already let, and her mother was
      determined not to hire another, but still to live as penuriously as
      possible, in order, notwithstanding his remonstrances, to save all she
      could of her income for her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Belfield, who
      very familiarly said she came to tell Cecilia they were <i>all in the
      wrong box</i> in letting her son know of the £10 bank note, &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
       continued she, &ldquo;he has a pride that would grace a duke, and he thinks
      nothing of his hardships, so long as nobody knows of them. So another time
      we must manage things better, and when we do him any good, not let him
      know a word of the matter. We'll settle it all among ourselves, and one
      day or other he'll be glad enough to thank us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who saw Miss Belfield colour with shame at the freedom of this
      hint, now arose to depart; but Mrs Belfield begged her not to go so soon,
      and pressed her with such urgency to again sit down, that she was obliged
      to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then began a warm commendation of her son, lavishly praising all his
      good qualities, and exalting even his defects, concluding with saying
      &ldquo;But, ma'am, for all he's such a complete gentleman, and for all he's made
      so much of, he was so diffident, I could not get him to call and thank you
      for the present you made him, though, when he went his last airing, I
      almost knelt to him to do it. But, with all his merit, he wants as much
      encouragement as a lady, for I can tell you it is not a little will do for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, amazed at this extraordinary speech, looked from the mother to
      the daughter in order to discover its meaning, which, however, was soon
      rendered plainer by what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pray now, ma'am, don't think him the more ungrateful for his shyness,
      for young ladies so high in the world as you are, must go pretty good
      lengths before a young man will get courage to speak to them. And though I
      have told my son over and over that the ladies never like a man the worse
      for being a little bold, he's so much down in the mouth that it has no
      effect upon him. But it all comes of his being brought up at the
      university, for that makes him think he knows better than I can tell him.
      And so, to be sure, he does. However, for all that, it is a hard thing
      upon a mother to find all she says goes just for nothing. But I hope
      you'll excuse him, ma'am, for it's nothing in the world but his
      over-modesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now stared with a look of so much astonishment and displeasure,
      that Mrs Belfield, suspecting she had gone rather too far, added &ldquo;I beg
      you won't take what I've said amiss, ma'am, for we mothers of families are
      more used to speak out than maiden ladies. And I should not have said so
      much, but only I was afraid you would misconstrue my son's backwardness,
      and so that he might be flung out of your favour at last, and all for
      nothing but having too much respect for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear mother!&rdquo; cried Miss Belfield, whose face was the colour of
      scarlet, &ldquo;pray!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter now?&rdquo; cried Mrs Belfield; &ldquo;you are as shy as your
      brother; and if we are all to be so, when are we to come to an
      understanding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not immediately, I believe indeed,&rdquo; said Cecilia, rising, &ldquo;but that we
      may not plunge deeper in our mistakes, I will for the present take my
      leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; cried Mrs Belfield, stopping her, &ldquo;pray don't go yet, for
      I've got a great many things I want to talk to you about. In the first
      place, ma'am, pray what is your opinion of this scheme for sending my son
      abroad into foreign parts? I don't know what you may think of it, but as
      to me, it half drives me out of my senses to have him taken away from me
      at last in that unnatural manner. And I'm sure, ma'am, if you would only
      put in a word against it, I dare say he would give it up without a demur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, disengaging herself from her hold, &ldquo;No, madam, you
      must apply to those friends who better understand his affairs, and who
      would have a deeper interest in detaining him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lack a day!&rdquo; cried Mrs Belfield, with scarcely smothered vexation, &ldquo;how
      hard it is to make these grand young ladies come to reason! As to my son's
      other friends, what good will it do for him to mind what they say? who can
      expect him to give up his journey, without knowing what amends he shall
      get for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must settle this matter with him at your leisure,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;I
      cannot now stay another moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Belfield, again finding she had been too precipitate, tried to draw
      back, saying &ldquo;Pray, ma'am, don't let what I have mentioned go against my
      son in your good opinion, for he knows no more of it than the furthest
      person in the world, as my daughter can testify for as to shyness, he's
      just as shy as a lady himself; so what good he ever got at the University,
      as to the matter of making his fortune, it's what I never could discover.
      However, I dare say he knows best; though when all comes to all, if I was
      to speak my mind, I think he's made but a poor hand of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who only through compassion to the blushing Henrietta forbore
      repressing this forwardness more seriously, merely answered Mrs Belfield
      by wishing her good morning; but, while she was taking a kinder leave of
      her timid daughter, the mother added &ldquo;As to the present, ma'am, you was so
      kind to make us, Henny can witness for me every penny of it shall go to my
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather meant it,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;for your daughter; but if it is of use
      to any body, my purpose is sufficiently answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Belfield again pressed her to sit down, but she would not again listen
      to her, coldly saying &ldquo;I am sorry you troubled Mr Belfield with any
      mention of what passed between his sister and me, but should you speak of
      it again, I beg you will explain to him that he had no concern in that
      little transaction, which belonged wholly to ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then hastened down stairs, followed, however, by Mrs Belfield, making
      awkward excuses for what she had said, intermixed with frequent hints that
      she knew all the time she was in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little incident, which convinced Cecilia Mrs Belfield was firmly
      persuaded she was in love with her son, gave her much uneasiness; she
      feared the son himself might entertain the same notion, and thought it
      most probable the daughter also had imbibed it, though but for the forward
      vulgarity of the sanguine mother, their opinions might long have remained
      concealed. Her benevolence towards them, notwithstanding its purity, must
      now therefore cease to be exerted; nor could she even visit Miss Belfield,
      since prudence, and a regard for her own character, seemed immediately to
      prohibit all commerce with the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus difficult,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;is the blameless use of riches, though;
      all who want them, think nothing so easy as their disposal! This family I
      have so much wished to serve, I may at last only have injured, since the
      disappointment of their higher expectations, may render all smaller
      benefits contemptible. And thus this unfortunate misconstruction of my
      good offices, robs them of a useful assistant, and deprives me at the same
      time of an amiable companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she returned home, she had a letter put into her hand which
      came from Mr Marriot, whose servant had twice called for an answer in the
      short time she had been absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter contained a most passionate avowal of the impression she had
      made on his heart the preceding evening, and an angry complaint that Mr
      Harrel had refused to hear his proposals. He entreated her permission to
      wait upon her for only five minutes, and concluded with the most fervent
      professions of respect and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precipitancy of this declaration served merely to confirm the opinion
      she had already conceived of the weakness of his understanding; but the
      obstinacy of Mr Harrel irritated and distressed her, though weary of
      expostulating with so hopeless a subject, whom neither reason nor
      gratitude could turn from his own purposes, she was obliged to submit to
      his management, and was well content, in the present instance, to affirm
      his decree. She therefore wrote a concise answer to her new admirer, in
      the usual form of civil rejection.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER iii. &mdash; AN ACCOMMODATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cecilia was informed the next morning that a young woman begged to speak
      with her, and upon sending for her up stairs, she saw, to her great
      surprise, Miss Belfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in fear and trembling, sent, she said, by her mother, to entreat
      her pardon for what had passed the preceding day; &ldquo;But I know, madam,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;you cannot pardon it, and therefore all that I mean to do is to
      clear my brother from any share in what was said, for indeed he has too
      much sense to harbour any such presumption; and to thank you with a most
      grateful heart for all the goodness you have shewn us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, modestly courtsying, she would have returned home; but Cecilia,
      much touched by her gentleness, took her hand, and kindly reviving her by
      assurances of esteem, entreated that she would lengthen her stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good is this, madam,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;after having so much reason to think
      so ill of me and of all of us I tried all in my power to undeceive my
      mother, or at least to keep her quiet; but she was so much persuaded she
      was right, that she never would listen to me, and always said, did I
      suppose it was for <i>me</i> you condescended to come so often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;most undoubtedly; had I not known you, however
      well I might have wished your brother, I should certainly not have visited
      at his house. But I am very happy to hear the mistake had spread no
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed, madam, I never once thought of it; and as to my brother, when
      my mother only hinted it to him, he was quite angry. But though I don't
      mean to vindicate what has happened, you will not, I hope, be displeased
      if I say my mother is much more pardonable than she seems to be, for the
      same mistake she made with you, she would have been as apt to have made
      with a princess; it was not, therefore, from any want of respect, but
      merely from thinking my brother might marry as high as he pleased, and
      believing no lady would refuse him, if he would but have the courage to
      speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia assured her she would think no more of the error, but told her
      that to avoid its renewal, she must decline calling upon her again till
      her brother was gone. She begged therefore to see her in Portman-square
      whenever she had leisure, repeatedly assuring her of her good opinion and
      regard, and of the pleasure with which she should seize every opportunity
      of shewing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted by a reception so kind, Miss Belfield remained with her all the
      morning; and when at last she was obliged to leave her, she was but too
      happy in being solicited to repeat her visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suffered one day only to elapse before she shewed her readiness to
      accept the friendship that was offered her; and Cecilia, much pleased by
      this eagerness, redoubled her efforts to oblige and to serve her.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time, hardly a day passed in which she did not call in
      Portman-square, where nothing in her reception was omitted that could
      contribute to her contentment. Cecilia was glad to employ her mind in any
      way that related not to Delvile, whom she now earnestly endeavoured to
      think of no more, denying herself even the pleasure of talking of him with
      Miss Belfield, by the name of <i>her brother's noble friend</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time she devised various methods, all too delicate to give
      even the shadow of offence, for making both useful and ornamental presents
      to her new favourite, with whom she grew daily more satisfied, and to whom
      she purposed hereafter offering a residence in her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial of intimacy, so difficult to the ablest to stand, and from which
      even the most faultless are so rarely acquitted, Miss Belfield sustained
      with honour. Cecilia found her artless, ingenuous, and affectionate; her
      understanding was good, though no pains had been taken to improve it; her
      disposition though ardent was soft, and her mind seemed informed by
      intuitive integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She communicated to Cecilia all the affairs of her family, disguising from
      her neither distress nor meanness, and seeking to palliate nothing but the
      grosser parts of the character of her mother. She seemed equally ready to
      make known to her even the most chosen secrets of her own bosom, for that
      such she had was evident, from a frequent appearance of absence and
      uneasiness which she took but little trouble to conceal. Cecilia, however,
      trusted not herself, in the present critical situation of her own mind,
      with any enquiries that might lead to a subject she was conscious she
      ought not to dwell upon; a short time, she hoped, would totally remove her
      suspence; but as she had much less reason to expect good than evil, she
      made it her immediate study to prepare for the worst, and therefore
      carefully avoided all discourse that by nourishing her tenderness, might
      weaken her resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus, in friendly conversation and virtuous forbearance, passed
      gravely, but not unhappily, the time of Cecilia, the rest of the house was
      very differently employed; feasting, revelling, amusements of all sorts
      were pursued with more eagerness than ever, and the alarm which so lately
      threatened their destruction, seemed now merely to heighten the avidity
      with which they were sought. Yet never was the disunion of happiness and
      diversion more striking and obvious; Mr Harrel, in spite of his natural
      levity, was seized from time to time with fits of horror that embittered
      his gayest moments, and cast a cloud upon all his enjoyments. Always an
      enemy to solitude, he now found it wholly insupportable, and ran into
      company of any sort, less from a hope of finding entertainment, than from
      a dread of spending half an hour by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who saw that his rapacity for pleasure encreased with his
      uneasiness, once more ventured to speak with his lady upon the subject of
      reformation; counselling her to take advantage of his present apparent
      discontent, which showed at least some sensibility of his situation, in
      order to point out to him the necessity of an immediate inspection into
      his affairs, which, with a total change in his way of life, was her only
      chance for snatching him from the dismal despondency into which he was
      sinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel declared herself unequal to following this advice, and said
      that her whole study was to find Mr Harrel amusement, for he was grown so
      ill-humoured and petulant she quite feared being alone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house therefore now was more crowded than ever, and nothing but
      dissipation was thought of. Among those who upon this plan were courted to
      it, the foremost was Mr Morrice, who, from a peculiar talent of uniting
      servility of conduct with gaiety of speech, made himself at once so
      agreeable and useful in the family, that in a short time they fancied it
      impossible to live without him. And Morrice, though his first view in
      obtaining admittance had been the cultivation of his acquaintance with
      Cecilia, was perfectly satisfied with the turn that matters had taken,
      since his utmost vanity had never led him to entertain any matrimonial
      hopes with her, and he thought his fortune as likely to profit from the
      civility of her friends as of herself. For Morrice, however flighty, and
      wild, had always at heart the study of his own interest; and though from a
      giddy forwardness of disposition he often gave offence, his meaning and
      his serious attention was not the less directed to the advancement of his
      own affairs; he formed no connection from which he hoped not some benefit,
      and he considered the acquaintance and friendship of his superiors in no
      other light than that of procuring him sooner or later recommendations to
      new clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Floyer also was more frequent than ever in his visits, and Mr
      Harrel, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Cecilia, contrived every
      possible opportunity of giving him access to her. Mrs Harrel herself,
      though hitherto neutral, now pleaded his cause with earnestness; and Mr
      Arnott, who had been her former refuge from this persecution, grew so
      serious and so tender in his devoirs, that unable any longer to doubt the
      sentiments she had inspired, she was compelled even with him to be guarded
      and distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now with daily concern looked back to the sacrifice she had made to
      the worthless and ungrateful Mr Harrel, and was sometimes tempted to
      immediately chuse another guardian, and leave his house for ever; yet the
      delicacy of her disposition was averse to any step that might publicly
      expose him, and her early regard for his wife would not suffer her to put
      it in execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      These circumstances contributed strongly to encrease her intimacy with
      Miss Belfield; she now never saw Mrs Delvile, whom alone she preferred to
      her, and from the troublesome assiduity of Sir Robert, scarce ever met Mr
      Monckton but in his presence; she found, therefore, no resource against
      teazing and vexation, but what was afforded her by the conversation of the
      amiable Henrietta.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER iv. &mdash; A DETECTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fortnight had now elapsed in which Cecilia had had no sort of
      communication with the Delviles, whom equally from pride and from prudence
      she forbore to seek for herself, when one morning, while she was sitting
      with Miss Belfield, her maid told her that young Mr Delvile was in the
      drawing-room, and begged the honour of seeing her for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though she started and changed colour with surprize at this
      message, was unconscious she did either, from the yet greater surprise she
      received by the behaviour of Miss Belfield, who hastily arising, exclaimed
      &ldquo;Good God, Mr Delvile!&mdash;do you know Mr Delvile, madam?&mdash;does Mr
      Delvile visit at this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes; not often,&rdquo; answered Cecilia; &ldquo;but why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&mdash;nothing, madam,&mdash;I only asked by accident, I
      believe,&mdash;but it's very&mdash;it's extremely&mdash;I did not know&rdquo;&mdash;and
      colouring violently, she again sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      An apprehension the most painful now took possession of Cecilia, and
      absorbed in thought, she continued for some minutes silent and immoveable.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this state she was awakened by her maid, who asked if she chose to
      have her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, taking them from her without speaking, left the room, and not
      daring to stop for enquiry or consideration, hastened down stairs; but
      when she entered the apartment where young Delvile was waiting for her,
      all utterance seemed denied her, and she courtsied without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck with the look and uncommon manner of her entrance, he became in a
      moment as much disturbed as herself, pouring forth a thousand unnecessary
      and embarrassed apologies for his visit, and so totally forgetting even
      the reason why he made it, that he had taken his leave and was departing
      before he recollected it. He then turned back, forcing a laugh at his own
      absence of mind, and told her he had only called to acquaint her, that the
      commands with which she had honoured him were now obeyed, and, he hoped,
      to her satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who knew not she had ever given him any, waited his further
      explanation; and he then informed her he had that very morning introduced
      Mr Belfield to the Earl of Vannelt, who had already heard him very
      advantageously spoken of by some gentlemen to whom he had been known at
      the University, and who was so much pleased with him upon this first
      interview, that he meant, after a few enquiries, which could not but turn
      out to his credit, to commit his eldest son to his trust in making the
      tour of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia thanked him for her share in the trouble he had taken in this
      transaction; and then asked if Mrs Delvile continued well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he, with a smile half reproachful, &ldquo;as well as one who
      having ever hoped your favour, can easily be after finding that hope
      disappointed. But much as she has taught her son, there is one lesson she
      might perhaps learn from him;&mdash;to fly, not seek, those dangerous
      indulgences of which the deprivation is the loss of peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then bowed, and made his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unexpected reproof, and the yet more unexpected compliment that
      accompanied it, in both which <i>more seemed meant than met the ear</i>,
      encreased the perturbation into which Cecilia had already been thrown. It
      occurred to her that under the sanction of his mother's name, he had taken
      an opportunity of making an apology for his own conduct; yet why avoiding
      her society, if to that he alluded, should be <i>flying a dangerous
      indulgence</i>, she could not understand, since he had so little reason to
      fear any repulse in continuing to seek it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry, however, for the abrupt manner in which she had left Miss Belfield,
      she lost not a moment in hastening back to her; but when she came into the
      room, she found her employed in looking out of the window, her eye
      following some object with such earnestness of attention, that she
      perceived not her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who could not doubt the motive of her curiosity, had no great
      difficulty in forbearing to offer her any interruption. She drew her head
      back in a few minutes, and casting it upwards, with her hands clasped,
      softly whispered, &ldquo;Heaven ever shield and bless him! and O may he never
      feel such pain as I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then again looked out, but soon drawing herself in, said, in the same
      soft accents, &ldquo;Oh why art thou gone! sweetest and noblest of men! why
      might I not see thee longer, when, under heaven, there is no other
      blessing I wish for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sigh which at these words escaped Cecilia made her start and turn
      towards the door; the deepest blushes overspread the cheeks of both as
      their eyes met each other, and while Miss Belfield trembled in every limb
      at the discovery she had made, Cecilia herself was hardly able to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A painful and most embarrassed silence succeeded, which was only broken by
      Miss Belfield's bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, extremely moved, forgot for a moment her own interest in what was
      passing, and tenderly approaching, embraced her with the utmost kindness;
      but still she spoke not, fearing to make an enquiry, from dreading to hear
      any explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Belfield, soothed by her softness, clung about her, and hiding her
      face in her arms, sobbed out, &ldquo;Ah madam! who ought to be unhappy if
      befriended by you! if I could help it, I would love nobody else in almost
      the whole world. But you must let me leave you now, and to-morrow I will
      tell you every thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who had no wish for making any opposition, embraced her again,
      and suffered her quietly to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own mind was now in a state of the utmost confusion. The rectitude of
      her heart and the soundness of her judgment had hitherto guarded her both
      from error and blame, and, except during her recent suspence, had
      preserved her tranquility inviolate; but her commerce with the world had
      been small and confined, and her actions had had little reference but to
      herself. The case was now altered; and she was suddenly in a conjuncture
      of all others the most delicate, that of accidentally discovering a rival
      in a favourite friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fondness she had conceived for Miss Belfield, and the sincerity of her
      intentions as well as promises to serve her, made the detection of this
      secret peculiarly cruel; she had lately felt no pleasure but in her
      society, and looked forward to much future comfort from the continuance of
      her regard, and from their constantly living together; but now this was no
      longer even to be desired, since the utter annihilation of the wishes of
      both, by young Delvile's being disposed of to a third person, could alone
      render eligible their dwelling under the same roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pity, however, for Miss Belfield was almost wholly unallayed by
      jealousy; she harboured not any suspicion that she was loved by young
      Delvile, whose aspiring spirit led her infinitely more to fear some higher
      rival, than to believe he bestowed even a thought upon the poor Henrietta;
      but still she wished with the utmost ardour to know the length of their
      acquaintance, how often they had met, when they had conversed, what notice
      he had taken of her, and how so dangerous a preference had invaded her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though this curiosity was both natural and powerful, her principal
      concern was the arrangement of her own conduct; the next day Miss Belfield
      was to tell her every thing by a voluntary promise; but she doubted if she
      had any right to accept such a confidence. Miss Belfield, she was sure,
      knew not she was interested in the tale, since she had not even imagined
      that Delvile was known to her. She might hope, therefore, not only for
      advice but assistance, and fancy that while she reposed her secret in the
      bosom of a friend, she secured herself her best offices and best wishes
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she obtain them? no; the most romantic generosity would revolt from
      such a demand, for however precarious was her own chance with young
      Delvile, Miss Belfield she was sure could not have any; neither her birth
      nor education fitted her for his rank in life, and even were both
      unexceptionable, the smallness of her fortune, as Mr Monckton had
      instructed her, would be an obstacle insurmountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it not be a kind of treachery to gather from her every thing, yet
      aid her in nothing? to take advantage of her unsuspicious openness in
      order to learn all that related to one whom she yet hoped would belong
      ultimately to herself, and gratify an interested curiosity at the expence
      of a candour not more simple than amiable? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;arts that
      I could never forgive, I never will practice; this sweet, but unhappy girl
      shall tell me nothing; betrayed already by the tenderness of her own
      heart, she shall at least suffer no further from any duplicity in mine.
      If, indeed, Mr Delvile, as I suspect, is engaged elsewhere, I will make
      this gentle Henrietta the object of my future solicitude; the sympathy of
      our situations will not then divide but unite us, and I will take her to
      my bosom, hear all her sorrows, and calm her troubled spirit by
      participating in her sensibility. But if, on the contrary, this mystery
      ends more happily for myself, if Mr Delvile has now no other engagement,
      and hereafter clears his conduct to my satisfaction, I will not be
      accessory to loading her future recollection with the shame of a
      confidence she then cannot but repent, nor with an injury to her delicacy
      that may wound it for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She determined, therefore, carefully to avoid the subject for the present,
      since she could offer no advice for which she might not, hereafter, be
      suspected of selfish motives; but yet, from a real regard to the
      tender-hearted girl, to give all the tacit discouragement that was in her
      power, to a passion which she firmly believed would be productive of
      nothing but misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, from the frankness natural to her disposition, she thought not
      merely of receiving but returning her confidence; her better judgment,
      however, soon led her from so hazardous a plan, which could only have
      exposed them both to a romantic humiliation, by which, in the end, their
      mutual expectations might prove sources of mutual distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Belfield, therefore, the next morning, her air unusually timid,
      and her whole face covered with blushes, made her visit, Cecilia, not
      seeming to notice her confusion, told her she was very sorry she was
      obliged to go out herself, and contrived, under various pretences, to keep
      her maid in the room. Miss Belfield, supposing this to be accidental,
      rejoiced in her imaginary reprieve, and soon recovered her usual
      chearfulness; and Cecilia, who really meant to call upon Mrs Delvile,
      borrowed Mrs Harrel's carriage, and set down her artless young friend at
      her new lodgings in Portland-street, before she proceeded to St
      James's-square, talking the whole time upon matters of utter indifference.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER v. &mdash; A SARCASM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reproach which Cecilia had received from young Delvile in the name of
      his mother, determined her upon making this visit; for though, in her
      present uncertainty, she wished only to see that family when sought by
      themselves, she was yet desirous to avoid all appearance of singularity,
      lest any suspicions should be raised of her sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile received her with a cold civility that chilled and afflicted
      her; she found her seriously offended by her long absence, and now for the
      first time perceived that haughtiness of character which hitherto she had
      thought only given to her by the calumny of envy; for though her
      displeasure was undisguised, she deigned not to make any reproaches,
      evidently shewing that her disappointment in the loss of her society, was
      embittered by a proud regret for the kindness she believed she had thrown
      away. But though she scrupulously forbore the smallest complaint, she
      failed not from time to time to cast out reflections upon fickleness and
      caprice the most satirical and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who could not possibly avow the motives of her behaviour,
      ventured not to offer any apology for her apparent negligence; but,
      hitherto accustomed to the most distinguished kindness, a change to so
      much bitterness shocked and overpowered her, and she sat almost wholly
      silent, and hardly able to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria Pemberton, a daughter of the Duke of Derwent, now came into
      the room, and afforded her some relief by the sprightliness of her
      conversation. This young lady, who was a relation of the Delviles, and of
      a character the most airy and unthinking, ran on during her whole visit in
      a vein of fashionable scandal, with a levity that the censures of Mrs
      Delvile, though by no means spared, had no power to [controul]; and, after
      having completely ransacked the topics of the day, she turned suddenly to
      Cecilia, with whom during her residence in St James's-square she had made
      some acquaintance, and said, &ldquo;So I hear, Miss Beverley, that after half
      the town has given you to Sir Robert Floyer, and the other half to my Lord
      Derford, you intend, without regarding one side or the other, to
      disappoint them both, and give yourself to Mr Marriot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? no, indeed,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;your ladyship has been much
      misinformed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;for Mr Marriot, by all I ever heard of
      him, seems to have but one recommendation, and that the last Miss Beverley
      ought to value, a good estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, secretly delighted by a speech which she could not resist
      flattering herself had reference to her son, now a little revived, and
      endeavoured to bear some part in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody one meets,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;disposes of Miss Beverley to
      some new person; yet the common opinion is that Sir Robert Floyer will be
      the man. But upon my word, for my own part, I cannot conjecture how she
      will manage among them, for Mr Marriot declares he's determined he won't
      be refused, and Sir Robert vows that he'll never give her up. So we none
      of us know how it will end; but I am vastly glad she keeps them so long in
      suspence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any suspence,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;I am at least sure it must be
      wilful. But why should your ladyship rejoice in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, because it helps to torment them, and keeps something going forward.
      Besides, we are all looking in the news-papers every day, to see when
      they'll fight another duel for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another?&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;indeed they have never yet fought any for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; answered her ladyship, &ldquo;Sir Robert, you know,
      fought one for you in the beginning of the winter, with that Irish
      fortune-hunter who affronted you at the Opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irish fortune-hunter?&rdquo; repeated Cecilia, &ldquo;how strangely has that quarrel
      been misrepresented! In the first place, I never was affronted at the
      Opera at all, and in the second, if your Ladyship means Mr Belfield, I
      question if he ever was in Ireland in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;he might come from Scotland, for aught I
      know, but somewhere he certainly came from; and they tell me he is wounded
      terribly, and Sir Robert has had all his things packed up this month, that
      in case he should die, he may go abroad in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray where, Lady Honoria,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;do you contrive to
      pick up all this rattle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don't know; everybody tells me something, so I put it all together
      as well as I can. But I could acquaint you with a stranger piece of news
      than any you have heard yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, if I let you know it, you'll tell your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile laughing, &ldquo;I shall probably forget it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then made some further difficulty, and Cecilia, uncertain if she was
      meant to be a party in the communication, strolled to a window; where,
      however, as Lady Honoria did not lower her voice, she heard her say &ldquo;Why
      you must know I am told he keeps a mistress somewhere in Oxford-Road. They
      say she's mighty pretty; I should like vastly to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consternation of Cecilia at this intelligence would certainly have
      betrayed all she so much wished to conceal, had not her fortunate removal
      to the window guarded her from observation. She kept her post, fearing to
      look round, but was much pleased when Mrs Delvile, with great indignation
      answered &ldquo;I am sorry, Lady Honoria, you can find any amusement in
      listening to such idle scandal, which those who tell will never respect
      you for hearing. In times less daring in slander, the character of
      Mortimer would have proved to him a shield from all injurious aspersions;
      yet who shall wonder he could not escape, and who shall contemn the
      inventors of calumny, if Lady Honoria Pemberton condescends to be
      entertained with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mrs Delvile,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, giddily, &ldquo;you take me too
      seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dear Lady Honoria,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;I would it were possible to
      make you take yourself seriously; for could you once see with clearness
      and precision how much you lower your own dignity, while you stoop to
      depreciate that of others, the very subjects that now make your diversion,
      would then, far more properly, move your resentment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay but, dear madam,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;if that were the case, I should
      be quite perfect, and then you and I should never quarrel, and I don't
      know what we should do for conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words, hastily shaking hands with her, she took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such conversation,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile when she was gone, &ldquo;as results from
      the mixture of fruitless admonition with incorrigible levity, would be
      indeed <i>more honoured in the breach than the observance</i>. But levity
      is so much the fashionable characteristic of the present age, that a gay
      young girl who, like Lady Honoria Pemberton, rules the friends by whom she
      ought to be ruled, had little chance of escaping it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems so open, however, to reproof,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;that I should
      hope in a short time she may also be open to conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;I have no hope of her at all. I once took
      much pains with her; but I soon found that the easiness with which she
      hears of her faults, is only another effect of the levity with which she
      commits them. But if the young are never tired of erring in conduct,
      neither are the older in erring in judgment; the fallibility of <i>mine</i>
      I have indeed very lately experienced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who strongly felt the poignancy of this sarcasm, and whose
      constant and unaffected value of Mrs Delvile by no means deserved it, was
      again silenced, and again most cruelly depressed; nor could she secretly
      forbear repining that at the very moment she found herself threatened with
      a necessity of foregoing the society of her new favourite, Miss Belfield,
      the woman in the whole world whom she most wished to have for her friend,
      from an unhappy mistake was ready to relinquish her. Grieved to be thus
      fallen in her esteem, and shocked that she could offer no justification,
      after a short and thoughtful pause, she gravely arose to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile then told her that if she had any business to transact with Mr
      Delvile, she advised her to acquaint him with it soon, as the whole family
      left town in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a new and severe blow to Cecilia, who sorrowfully repeated &ldquo;In a
      few days, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;I hope you intend to be much concerned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah madam!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, who could no longer preserve her quietness, &ldquo;if
      you knew but half the respect I bear you, but half the sincerity with
      which I value and revere you, all protestations would be useless, for all
      accusations would be over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, at once surprised and softened by the warmth of this
      declaration, instantly took her hand, and said &ldquo;They shall now, and for
      ever be over, if it pains you to hear them. I concluded that what I said
      would be a matter of indifference to you, or all my displeasure would
      immediately have been satisfied, when once I had intimated that your
      absence had excited it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I have excited it at all,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;gives me indeed the
      severest uneasiness; but believe me, madam, however unfortunately
      appearances maybe against me, I have always had the highest sense of the
      kindness with which you have honoured me, and never has there been the
      smallest abatement in the veneration, gratitude, and affection I have
      inviolably borne you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, then,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile with a smile, &ldquo;that where reproof takes
      any effect, it is not received; with that easiness you were just now
      admiring; on the contrary, where a concession is made without pain, it is
      also made without meaning, for it is not in human nature to project any
      amendment without a secret repugnance. That here, however, you should
      differ from Lady Honoria Pemberton, who can wonder, when you are superior
      to all comparison with her in every thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you then,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;accept my apology, and forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do more,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile laughing, &ldquo;I will forgive you <i>without</i>
      an apology; for the truth is I have heard none! But come,&rdquo; continued she,
      perceiving Cecilia much abashed by this comment, &ldquo;I will enquire no more
      about the matter; I am glad to receive my young friend again, and even
      half ashamed, deserving as she is, to say <i>how</i> glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then embraced her affectionately, and owned she had been more
      mortified by her fancied desertion than she had been willing to own even
      to herself, repeatedly assuring her that for many years she had not made
      any acquaintance she so much wished to cultivate, nor enjoyed any society
      from which she had derived so much pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, whose eyes glistened with modest joy, while her heart beat quick
      with revived expectation, in listening to an effusion of praise so
      infinitely grateful to her, found little difficulty in returning her
      friendly professions, and, in a few minutes, was not merely reconciled,
      but more firmly united with her than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile insisted upon keeping her to dinner, and Cecilia, but too
      happy in her earnestness, readily agreed to send Mrs Harrel an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the Mr Delviles spent the day at home, and nothing, therefore,
      disturbed or interrupted those glowing and delightful sensations which
      spring from a cordial renewal of friendship and kindness. The report,
      indeed, of Lady Honoria Pemberton gave her some uneasiness, yet the
      flighty character of that lady, and Mrs Delvile's reply to it, soon made
      her drive it from her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned home early in the evening, as other company was expected, and
      she had not changed her dress since the morning; but she first made a
      promise to see Mrs Delvile some part of every day during the short time
      that she meant to remain in town.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER vi. &mdash; A SURMISE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning opened with another scene; Mrs Harrel ran into Cecilia's
      room before breakfast, and acquainted her that Mr Harrel had not been at
      home all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consternation with which she heard this account she instantly
      endeavoured to dissipate, in order to soften the apprehension with which
      it was communicated; Mrs Harrel, however, was extremely uneasy, and sent
      all the town over to make enquiries, but without receiving any
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, unwilling to leave her in a state of such alarm, wrote an excuse
      to Mrs Delvile, that she might continue with her till some information was
      procured. A subject also of such immediate concern, was sufficient apology
      for avoiding any particular conversation with Miss Belfield, who called,
      as usual, about noon, and whose susceptible heart was much affected by the
      evident disturbance in which she found Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole day passed, and no news arrived; but, greatly to her
      astonishment, Mrs Harrel in the evening prepared for going to an assembly!
      yet declaring at the same time it was extremely disagreeable to her, only
      she was afraid, if she stayed away, every body would suppose something was
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who then at last, thought Cecilia, are half so much the slaves of the
      world as the gay and the dissipated? Those who work for hire, have at
      least their hours of rest, those who labour for subsistence are at liberty
      when subsistence is procured; but those who toil to please the vain and
      the idle, undertake a task which can never be finished, however
      scrupulously all private peace, and all internal comfort, may be
      sacrificed in reality to the folly of saving appearances!
    </p>
    <p>
      Losing, however, the motive for which she had given up her own engagement,
      she now sent for her chair, in order to spend an hour or two with Mrs
      Delvile. The servants, as they conducted her up stairs, said they would
      call their lady; and in entering the drawing-room she saw, reading and
      alone, young Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed much surprised, but received her with the utmost respect,
      apologizing for the absence of his mother, whom he said had understood she
      was not to see her till the next day, and had left him to write letters
      now, that she might then be at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia in return made excuses for her seeming inconsistency; after which,
      for some time, all conversation dropt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was at length broken by young Delvile's saying &ldquo;Mr Belfield's
      merit has not been thrown away upon Lord Vannelt; he has heard an
      excellent character of him from all his former acquaintance, and is now
      fitting up an apartment for him in his own house till his son begins his
      tour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia said she was very happy in hearing such intelligence; and then
      again they were both silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen,&rdquo; said young Delvile, after this second pause, &ldquo;Mr
      Belfield's sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, not without changing colour, answered &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very amiable,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;too amiable, indeed, for her
      situation, since her relations, her brother alone excepted, are all
      utterly unworthy of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopt; but Cecilia made no answer, and he presently added &ldquo;Perhaps you
      do not think her amiable?&mdash;you may have seen more of her, and know
      something to her disadvantage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with a forced alacrity, &ldquo;but only I was thinking
      that&mdash;did you say you knew all her relations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but when I have been with Mr Belfield, some of them
      have called upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they were both silent; and then Cecilia, ashamed of her apparent
      backwardness to give praise, compelled herself to say, &ldquo;Miss Belfield is
      indeed a very sweet girl, and I wish&mdash;&rdquo; she stopt, not well knowing
      herself what she meant to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been greatly pleased,&rdquo; said he, after waiting some time to hear if
      she would finish her speech, &ldquo;by being informed of your goodness to her,
      and I think she seems equally to require and to deserve it. I doubt not
      you will extend it to her when she is deprived of her brother, for then
      will be the time that by doing her most service, it will reflect on
      yourself most honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, confounded by this recommendation, faintly answered &ldquo;Certainly,&mdash;whatever
      is in my power,&mdash;I shall be very glad&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And just then Mrs Delvile made her appearance, and during the mutual
      apologies that followed, her son left the room. Cecilia, glad of any
      pretence to leave it also, insisted upon giving no interruption to Mrs
      Delvile's letter writing, and having promised to spend all the next day
      with her, hurried back to her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflections that followed her thither were by no means the most
      soothing; she began now to apprehend that the pity she had bestowed upon
      Miss Belfield, Miss Belfield in a short time might bestow upon her; at any
      other time, his recommendation would merely have served to confirm her
      opinion of his benevolence, but in her present state of anxiety and
      uncertainty, every thing gave birth to conjecture, and had power to alarm
      her. He had behaved to her of late with the strangest coldness and
      distance,&mdash;his praise of Henrietta had been ready and animated,&mdash;Henrietta
      she knew adored him, and she knew not with what reason,&mdash;but an
      involuntary suspicion arose in her mind, that the partiality she had
      herself once excited, was now transferred to that little dreaded, but not
      less dangerous rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, if such was the case, what was to become either of the pride or the
      interest of his family? Would his relations ever pardon an alliance
      stimulated neither by rank nor riches? would Mr Delvile, who hardly ever
      spoke but to the high-born, without seeming to think his dignity somewhat
      injured, deign to receive for a daughter-in-law the child of a citizen and
      tradesman? would Mrs Delvile herself, little less elevated in her notions,
      though infinitely softer in her manners, ever condescend to acknowledge
      her? Cecilia's own birth and connections, superior as they were to those
      of Miss Belfield, were even openly disdained by Mr Delvile, and all her
      expectations of being received into his family were founded upon the
      largeness of her fortune, in favour of which the brevity of her genealogy
      might perhaps pass unnoticed. But what was the chance of Miss Belfield,
      who neither had ancestors to boast, nor wealth to allure?
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought, however, awakened all the generosity of her soul; &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
       cried she, &ldquo;the advantages I possess are merely those of riches, how
      little should I be flattered by any appearance of preference! and how ill
      can I judge with what sincerity it may be offered! happier in that case is
      the lowly Henrietta, who to poverty may attribute neglect, but who can
      only be sought and caressed from motives of purest regard. She loves Mr
      Delvile, loves him with the most artless affection;&mdash;perhaps, too, he
      loves her in return,&mdash;why else his solicitude to know my opinion of
      her, and why so sudden his alarm when he thought it unfavourable? Perhaps
      he means to marry her, and to sacrifice to her innocence and her
      attractions all plans of ambition, and all views of aggrandizement;&mdash;thrice
      happy Henrietta, if such is thy prospect of felicity! to have inspired a
      passion so disinterested, may humble the most insolent of thy superiors,
      and teach even the wealthiest to envy thee!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER vii. &mdash; A BOLD STROKE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Cecilia returned home, she heard with much concern that no tidings of
      Mr Harrel had yet been obtained. His lady, who did not stay out late, was
      now very seriously frightened, and entreated Cecilia to sit up with her
      till some news could be procured; she sent also for her brother, and they
      all three, in trembling expectation of what was to ensue, passed the whole
      night in watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock in the morning, Mr Arnott besought his sister and Cecilia
      to take some rest, promising to go out himself to every place where Mr
      Harrel was known to resort, and not to return without bringing some
      account of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, whose feelings were not very acute, finding the persuasions of
      her brother were seconded by her own fatigue, consented to follow his
      advice, and desired him to begin his search immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after he was gone, while Mrs Harrel and Cecilia were upon
      the stairs, they were startled by a violent knocking at the door; Cecilia,
      prepared for some calamity, hurried her friend back to the drawing-room,
      and then flying out of it again to enquire who entered, saw to her equal
      surprize and relief, Mr Harrel himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran back with the welcome information, and he instantly followed her;
      Mrs Harrel eagerly told him of her fright, and Cecilia expressed her
      pleasure at his return; but the satisfaction of neither was of long
      duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came into the room with a look of fierceness the most terrifying, his
      hat on, and his arms folded. He made no answer to what they said, but
      pushed back the door with his foot, and flung himself upon a sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia would now have withdrawn, but Mrs Harrel caught her hand to
      prevent her. They continued some minutes in this situation, and then Mr
      Harrel, suddenly rising, called-out &ldquo;Have you any thing to pack up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack up?&rdquo; repeated Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;Lord bless me, for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going abroad,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I shall set off to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abroad?&rdquo; cried she, bursting into tears, &ldquo;I am sure I hope not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope nothing!&rdquo; returned he, in a voice of rage; and then, with a dreadful
      oath, he ordered her to leave him and pack up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, wholly unused to such treatment, was frightened into violent
      hysterics; of which, however, he took no notice, but swearing at her for
      <i>a fool who had been the cause of his ruin</i>, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though she instantly rang the bell, and hastened to her
      assistance, was so much shocked by this unexpected brutality, that she
      scarcely knew how to act, or what to order. Mrs Harrel, however, soon
      recovered, and Cecilia accompanied her to her own apartment, where she
      stayed, and endeavoured to sooth her till Mr Arnott returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible state in which Mr Harrel had at last come home was
      immediately communicated to him, and his sister entreated him to use all
      his influence that the scheme for going abroad might be deferred, at
      least, if not wholly given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearfully he went on the embassy, but speedily, and with a look wholly
      dismayed, he returned. Mr Harrel, he said, told him that he had contracted
      a larger debt of honour than he had any means to raise, and as he could
      not appear till it was paid, he was obliged to quit the kingdom without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh brother!&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;and can you suffer us to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear sister,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;what can I do to prevent it? and
      who, if I too am ruined, will in future help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel then wept bitterly, nor could the gentle Mr Arnott, forbear,
      while he tried to comfort her, mixing his own tears with those of his
      beloved sister; but Cecilia, whose reason was stronger, and whose justice
      was offended, felt other sensations; and leaving Mrs Harrel to the care of
      her brother, whose tenderness she infinitely compassionated, she retreated
      into her own room. Not, however, to rest; the dreadful situation of the
      family made her forget she wanted it, but to deliberate upon what course
      she ought herself to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She determined without any hesitation against accompanying them in their
      flight, as the irreparable injury she was convinced she had already done
      her fortune, was more than sufficient to satisfy the most romantic ideas
      of friendship and humanity; but her own place of abode must now
      immediately be changed, and her choice rested only between Mr Delvile and
      Mr Briggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important as were the obstacles which opposed her residence at Mr
      Delvile's, all that belonged to inclination and to happiness encouraged
      it; while with respect to Mr Briggs, though the objections were lighter,
      there was not a single allurement. Yet whenever the suspicion recurred to
      her that Miss Belfield was beloved by young Delvile, she resolved at all
      events to avoid him; but when better hopes intervened, and represented
      that his enquiries were probably accidental, the wish of being finally
      acquainted with his sentiments, made nothing so desirable as an
      intercourse more frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such still was her irresolution, when she received a message from Mr
      Arnott to entreat the honour of seeing her. She immediately went down
      stairs, and found him in the utmost distress, &ldquo;O Miss Beverley,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;what can I do for my sister! what can I possibly devise to relieve her
      affliction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I know not!&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;but the utter impracticability of
      preparing her for this blow, obviously as it has long been impending,
      makes it now fall so heavily I wish much to assist her,&mdash;but a debt
      so unjustifiably contracted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O madam,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;imagine not I sent to you with so treacherous
      a view as to involve you in our misery; far too unworthily has your
      generosity already been abused. I only wish to consult with you what I can
      do for my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, after some little consideration, proposed that Mrs Harrel should
      still be left in England, and under their joint care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I have already made that proposal, but Mr Harrel will
      not go without her, though his whole behaviour is so totally altered, that
      I fear to trust her with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there, then, that has more weight with him?&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;shall
      we send for Sir Robert Floyer to second our request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Mr Arnott assented, forgetting in his apprehension of losing his
      sister, the pain he should suffer from the interference of his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baronet presently arrived, and Cecilia, not chusing to apply to him
      herself, left him with Mr Arnott, and waited for intelligence in the
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour after, Mrs Harrel ran into the room, her tears dried up,
      and out of breath with joy, and called out &ldquo;My dearest friend, my fate is
      now all in your hands, and I am sure you will not refuse to make me
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it I can do for you?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, dreading some impracticable
      proposal; &ldquo;ask me not, I beseech you, what I cannot perform!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;What I ask requires nothing but good nature; Sir
      Robert Floyer has been begging Mr Harrel to leave me behind, and he has
      promised to comply, upon condition you will hasten your marriage, and take
      me into your own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My marriage!&rdquo; cried the astonished Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they were joined by Mr Harrel himself, who repeated the same offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both amaze and shock me!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;what is it you mean, and
      why do you talk to me so wildly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley,&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, &ldquo;it is high time now to give up this
      reserve, and trifle no longer with a gentleman so unexceptionable as Sir
      Robert Floyer. The whole town has long acknowledged him as your husband,
      and you are every where regarded as his bride, a little frankness,
      therefore, in accepting him, will not only bind him to you for ever, but
      do credit to the generosity of your character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Sir Robert himself burst into the room, and seizing one of
      her hands, while both of them were uplifted in mute amazement, he pressed
      it to his lips, poured forth a volley of such compliments as he had never
      before prevailed with himself to utter, and confidently entreated her to
      complete his long-attended happiness without the cruelty of further delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, almost petrified by the excess of her surprise, at an attack so
      violent, so bold, and apparently so sanguine, was for some time scarce
      able to speak or to defend herself; but when Sir Robert, presuming on her
      silence, said she had made him the happiest of men, she indignantly drew
      back her hand, and with a look of displeasure that required little
      explanation, would have walked out of the room; when Mr Harrel, in a tone
      of bitterness and disappointment, called out &ldquo;Is this lady-like tyranny
      then never to end?&rdquo; And Sir Robert, impatiently following her, said &ldquo;And
      is my suspense to endure for ever? After so many months' attendance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, indeed, is something too much,&rdquo; said Cecilia, turning back, &ldquo;You
      have been kept, Sir, in no suspense; the whole tenor of my conduct has
      uniformly declared the same disapprobation I at present avow, and which my
      letter, at least, must have put beyond all doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrel,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Robert, &ldquo;did not you tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho, Pho,&rdquo; cried Harrel, &ldquo;what signifies calling upon me? I never saw in
      Miss Beverley any disapprobation beyond what it is customary for young
      ladies of a sentimental turn to shew; and every body knows that where a
      gentleman is allowed to pay his devoirs for any length of time, no lady
      intends to use him very severely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you, Mr Harrel,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;after such conversations as have
      passed between us, persevere in this wilful misapprehension? But it is
      vain to debate where all reasoning is disregarded, or to make any
      protestations where even rejection is received as a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with an air of disdain, she insisted upon passing them, and went
      to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, however, still followed, and clinging round her, still
      supplicated her pity and compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What infatuation is this!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;is it possible that you, too,
      can suppose I ever mean to accept Sir Robert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;for Mr Harrel has told me a thousand
      times, that however you played the prude, you would be his at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though doubly irritated against Mr Harrel, was now appeased with
      his lady, whose mistake, however ill-founded, offered an excuse for her
      behaviour; but she assured her in the strongest terms that her repugnance
      to the Baronet was unalterable, yet told her she might claim from her
      every good office that was not wholly unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were words of slender comfort to Mrs Harrel, who well knew that her
      wishes and reason had but little affinity, and she soon, therefore, left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then resolved to go instantly to Mrs Delvile, acquaint her with
      the necessity of her removal, and make her decision whither, according to
      the manner in which her intelligence should be received.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent, therefore, to order a chair, and was already in the hall, when
      she was stopt by the entrance of Mr Monckton, who, addressing her with a
      look of haste and earnestness, said, &ldquo;I will not ask whither you are going
      so early, or upon what errand, for I must beg a moment's audience, be your
      business what it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then accompanied him to the deserted breakfast room, which none
      but the servants had this morning entered, and there, grasping her hand,
      he said, &ldquo;Miss Beverley, you must fly this house directly! it is the
      region of disorder and licentiousness, and unfit to contain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She assured him she was that moment preparing to quit it, but begged he
      would explain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken care,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for some time past, to be well informed
      of all the proceedings of Mr Harrel; and the intelligence I procured this
      morning is of the most alarming nature. I find he spent the night before
      the last entirely at a gaming table, where, intoxicated by a run of good
      luck, he passed the whole of the next day in rioting with his profligate
      intimates, and last night, returning again to his favourite amusement, he
      not only lost all he had gained, but much more than he could pay. Doubt
      not, therefore, but you will be called upon to assist him; he still
      considers you as his resource in times of danger, and while he knows you
      are under his roof, he will always believe himself secure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing indeed conspires,&rdquo; said Cecilia, more shocked than surprised
      at this account, &ldquo;to make it necessary I should quit his house; yet I do
      not think he has at present any further expectations from me, as he came
      into the room this morning not merely without speaking to me, but behaved
      with a brutality to Mrs Harrel that he must be certain would give me
      disgust. It shewed me, indeed, a new part of his character, for ill as I
      have long thought of him, I did not suspect he could be guilty of such
      unmanly cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The character of a gamester,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, &ldquo;depends solely upon his
      luck; his disposition varies with every throw of the dice, and he is airy,
      gay and good humoured, or sour, morose and savage, neither from nature nor
      from principle, but wholly by the caprice of chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then related to him the scene in which she had just been engaged
      with Sir Robert Floyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;is a <i>manoeuvre</i> I have been some time expecting;
      but Mr Harrel, though artful and selfish, is by no means deep. The plan he
      had formed would have succeeded with some women, and he therefore
      concluded it would with all. So many of your sex have been subdued by
      perseverance, and so many have been conquered by boldness, that he
      supposed when he united two such powerful besiegers in the person of a
      Baronet, he should vanquish all obstacles. By assuring you that the world
      thought the marriage already settled, he hoped to surprise you into
      believing there was no help for it, and by the suddenness and vehemence of
      the attack, to frighten and hurry you into compliance. His own wife, he
      knew, might have been managed thus with ease, and so, probably, might his
      sister, and his mother, and his cousin, for in love matters, or what are
      so called, women in general are, readily duped. He discerned not the
      superiority of your understanding to tricks so shallow and impertinent,
      nor the firmness of your mind in maintaining its own independence. No
      doubt but he was amply to have been rewarded for his assistance, and
      probably had you this morning been propitious, the Baronet in return was
      to have cleared him from his present difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in my own mind,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;I can no longer defend him, for he
      could never have been so eager to promote the interest of Sir Robert, in
      the present terrible situation of his own affairs, had he not been
      stimulated by some secret motives. His schemes and his artifices, however,
      will now be utterly lost upon me, since your warning and advice, aided by
      my own suffering experience of the inutility of all I can do for him, will
      effectually guard me from all his future attempts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest no security upon yourself,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, &ldquo;since you have no
      knowledge of the many tricks and inventions by which you may yet be
      plundered. Perhaps he may beg permission to reside in your house in
      Suffolk, or desire an annuity for his wife, or chuse to receive your first
      rents when you come of age; and whatever he may fix upon, his dagger and
      his bowl will not fail to procure him. A heart so liberal as yours can
      only be guarded by flight. You were going, you said, when I came,&mdash;and
      whither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;to St James's-square,&rdquo; answered she, with a deep blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;is young Delvile, then, going abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abroad?&mdash;no,&mdash;I believe not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I only imagined it from your chusing to reside in his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not chuse it,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with quickness, &ldquo;but is not any thing
      preferable to dwelling with Mr Briggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton coolly, &ldquo;nor should I have supposed he had
      any chance with you, had I not hitherto observed that your convenience has
      always been sacrificed to your sense of propriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, touched by praise so full of censure, and earnest to vindicate
      her delicacy, after an internal struggle, which Mr Monckton was too subtle
      to interrupt, protested she would go instantly to Mr Briggs, and see if it
      were possible to be settled in his house, before she made any attempt to
      fix herself elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when?&rdquo; said Mr Monckton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered she, with some hesitation, &ldquo;perhaps this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go out no where this morning; I must stay with Mrs Harrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought otherwise when I came, you were then content to leave her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's alacrity, however, for changing her abode, was now at an end,
      and she would fain have been left quietly to re-consider her plans; but Mr
      Monckton urged so strongly the danger of her lengthened stay in the house
      of so designing a man as Mr Harrel, that he prevailed with her to quit it
      without delay, and had himself the satisfaction of handing her to her
      chair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER viii. &mdash; A MISER'S MANSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr Briggs was at home, and Cecilia instantly and briefly informed him that
      it was inconvenient for her to live any longer at Mr Harrel's, and that if
      she could be accommodated at his house, she should be glad to reside with
      him during the rest of her minority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall, shall,&rdquo; cried he, extremely pleased, &ldquo;take you with all my heart.
      Warrant Master Harrel's made a good penny of you. Not a bit the better for
      dressing so fine; many a rogue in a gold lace hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia begged to know what apartments he could spare for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take you up stairs,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;shew you a place for a queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then led her up stairs, and took her to a room entirely dark, and so
      close for want of air that she could hardly breathe in it. She retreated
      to the landing-place till he had opened the shutters, and then saw an
      apartment the most forlorn she had ever beheld, containing no other
      furniture than a ragged stuff bed, two worn-out rush-bottomed chairs, an
      old wooden box, and a bit of broken glass which was fastened to the wall
      by two bent nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, my little chick,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;everything ready! and a box for
      your gimcracks into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean this place for me, Sir!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, do;&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;a deal nicer by and by. Only wants a little
      furbishing; soon put to rights. Never sweep a room out of use; only wears
      out brooms for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sir, can I not have an apartment on the first floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, something else to do with it; belongs to the club; secrets in all
      things! Make this do well enough. Come again next week; wear quite a new
      face. Nothing wanting but a table; pick you up one at a broker's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am obliged, Sir, to leave Mr Harrel's house directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, make shift without a table at first; no great matter if you
      ha'n't one at all, nothing particular to do with it. Want another blanket,
      though. Know where to get one; a very good broker hard by. Understand how
      to deal with him! A close dog, but warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have also two servants, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't have 'em! Sha'n't come! Eat me out of house and home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever they eat, Sir,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;will be wholly at my expence, as
      will everything else that belongs to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better get rid of them; hate servants; all a pack of rogues; think of
      nothing but stuffing and guzzling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then opening another door, &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my own room just by;
      snug as a church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, following him into it, lost a great part of her surprise at the
      praise he had lavished upon that which he destined for herself, by
      perceiving that his own was yet more scantily furnished, having nothing in
      it but a miserable bed without any curtains, and a large chest, which,
      while it contained his clothes, sufficed both for table and chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are doing here?&rdquo; cried he angrily, to a maid who was making the bed,
      &ldquo;can't you take more care? beat 'out all the feathers, see! two on the
      ground; nothing but waste and extravagance! never mind how soon a man's
      ruined. Come to want, you slut, see that, come to want!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never want more than I do here,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;so that's one
      comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now began to repent she had made known the purport of her visit,
      for she found it would be utterly impossible to accommodate either her
      mind or her person to a residence such as was here to be obtained and she
      only wished Mr Monckton had been present, that he might himself be
      convinced of the impracticability of his scheme. Her whole business,
      therefore, now, was to retract her offer, and escape from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Sir,&rdquo; said she, when he turned from his servant, &ldquo;that I cannot be
      received here without inconvenience, and therefore I will make some new
      arrangement in my plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;like to have you, 'tis but fair, all in our turn;
      won't be chorused; Master Harrel's had his share. Sorry could not get you
      that sweetheart! would not bite; soon find out another; never fret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are so many things with which I cannot possibly dispense,&rdquo; said
      Cecilia, &ldquo;that I am certain my removing hither would occasion you far more
      trouble than you at present foresee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; get all in order soon; go about myself; know how to bid;
      understand trap; always go shabby; no making a bargain in a good coat.
      Look sharp at the goods; say they won't do; come away; send somebody else
      for 'em. Never go twice myself; nothing got cheap if one seems to have a
      hankering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am sure it is not possible,&rdquo; said Cecilia, hurrying down stairs,
      &ldquo;that my room, and one for each of my servants, should be ready in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried he, following her, &ldquo;ready in a trice. Make a little
      shift at first; double the blanket till we get another; lie with the maid
      a night or two; never stand for a trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when she was seated in her chair, the whole time disclaiming her
      intention of returning, he only pinched her cheek with a facetious smirk,
      and said, &ldquo;By, by, little duck; come again soon. Warrant I'll have the
      room ready. Sha'n't half know it again; make it as smart as a carrot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she left the house; fully satisfied that no one could blame her
      refusing to inhabit it, and much less chagrined than she was willing to
      suppose herself, in finding she had now no resource but in the Delviles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in her serious reflections, she could not but think herself strangely
      unfortunate that the guardian with whom alone it seemed proper for her to
      reside, should by parsimony, vulgarity, and meanness, render riches
      contemptible, prosperity unavailing, and economy odious; and that the
      choice of her uncle should thus unhappily have fallen upon the lowest and
      most wretched of misers, in a city abounding with opulence, hospitality,
      and splendour, and of which the principal inhabitants, long eminent for
      their wealth and their probity, were now almost universally rising in
      elegance and liberality.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ix. &mdash; A DECLARATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cecilia's next progress, therefore, was to St James's-square, whither she
      went in the utmost anxiety, from her uncertainty of the reception with
      which her proposal would meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants informed her that Mr and Mrs Delvile were at breakfast, and
      that the Duke of Derwent and his two daughters were with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before such witnesses to relate the reasons of her leaving the Harmless
      was impossible; and from such a party to send for Mrs Delvile, would, by
      her stately guardian, be deemed an indecorum unpardonable. She was
      obliged, therefore, to return to Portman-square, in order to open her
      cause in a letter to Mrs Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arnott, flying instantly to meet her, called out, &ldquo;O madam, what alarm
      has your absence occasioned! My sister believed she should see you no
      more, Mr Harrel feared a premature discovery of his purposed retreat, and
      we have all been under the cruellest apprehensions lest you meant not to
      come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I spoke not with you before I went out,&rdquo; said Cecilia,
      accompanying him to the library, &ldquo;but I thought you were all too much
      occupied to miss me. I have been, indeed, preparing for a removal, but I
      meant not to leave your sister without bidding her adieu, nor, indeed, to
      quit any part of the family with so little ceremony. Is Mr Harrel still
      firm to his last plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so! I have tried what is possible to dissuade him, and my poor
      sister has wept without ceasing. Indeed, if she will take no consolation,
      I believe I shall do what she pleases, for I cannot bear the sight of her
      in such distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too generous, and too good!&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;and I know not how,
      while flying from danger myself, to forbear counselling you to avoid it
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah madam!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the greatest danger for <i>me</i> is what I have
      now no power to run from!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though she could not but understand him, felt not the less his
      friend for knowing him the humblest of her admirers; and as she saw the
      threatening ruin to which his too great tenderness exposed him, she kindly
      said &ldquo;Mr Arnott, I will speak, to you without reserve. It is not difficult
      to see that the destruction which awaits Mr Harrel, is ready also to
      ensnare his brother-in-law; but let not that blindness to the future which
      we have so often lamented for him, hereafter be lamented for yourself.
      Till his present connections are broken, and his way of living is changed,
      nothing can be done for him, and whatever you were to advance, would
      merely be sunk at the gaming table. Reserve, therefore, your liberality
      till it may indeed be of service to him, for believe me, at present, his
      mind is as much injured as his fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it possible, madam,&rdquo; said Mr Arnott, in an accent of surprize and
      delight, &ldquo;that you can deign to be interested in what may become of me!
      and that my sharing or escaping the ruin of this house is not wholly
      indifferent to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; answered Cecilia; &ldquo;as the brother of my earliest friend,
      I can never be insensible to your welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah madam!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;as her brother!&mdash;Oh that there were any other
      tie!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think a little,&rdquo; said Cecilia, preparing to quit the room, &ldquo;of what I
      have mentioned, and, for your sister's sake, be firm now, if you would be
      kind hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be any and every thing,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that Miss Beverley will
      command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, fearful of any misinterpretation, then came back, and gravely
      said, &ldquo;No, Sir, be ruled only by your own judgment; or, should my advice
      have any weight with you, remember it is given from the most disinterested
      motives, and with no other view than that of securing your power to be of
      service to your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that sister's sake, then, have the goodness to hear my situation, and
      honour me with further directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make me fear to speak,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;if you give so much
      consequence to my opinion. I have seen, however, nothing in your conduct I
      have ever wished changed, except too little attention to your own interest
      and affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;with what rapture should I hear those words, could I but
      imagine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Cecilia, smiling, &ldquo;no digression! You called me back to
      talk of your sister; if you change your subject, perhaps you may lose your
      auditor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not, madam, for the world encroach upon your goodness; the favour
      I have found has indeed always exceeded my expectations, as it has always
      surpassed my desert; yet has it never blinded me to my own unworthiness.
      Do not, then, fear to indulge me with your conversation; I shall draw from
      it no inference but of pity, and though pity from Miss Beverley is the
      sweetest balm to my heart, it shall never seduce me to the encouragement
      of higher hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had long had reason to expect such a declaration, yet she heard it
      with unaffected concern, and looking at him with the utmost gentleness,
      said &ldquo;Mr Arnott, your regard does me honour, and, were it somewhat more
      rational, would give me pleasure; take, then, from it what is more than I
      wish or merit, and, while you preserve the rest, be assured it will be
      faithfully returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your rejection is so mild,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that I, who had no hope of
      acceptance, find relief in having at last told my sufferings. Could I but
      continue to see you every day, and to be blest with your conversation, I
      think I should be happy, and I am sure I should be grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are already,&rdquo; answered she, shaking her head, and moving towards the
      door, &ldquo;infringing the conditions upon which our friendship is to be
      founded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not go, madam,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;till I have done what you have just
      promised to permit, acquainted you with my situation, and been honoured
      with your advice. I must own to you, then, that £5000, which I had in the
      stocks, as well as a considerable sum in a banker's hands, I have parted
      with, as I now find for ever but I have no heart for refusal, nor would my
      sister at this moment be thus distressed, but that I have nothing more to
      give without I cut down my trees, or sell some farm, since all I was
      worth, except my landed property, is already gone. What, therefore, I can
      now do to save Mr Harrel from this desperate expedition I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;to speak with severity of one so nearly
      connected with you, yet, suffer me to ask, why should he be saved from it
      at all? and what is there he can at present do better? Has not he long
      been threatened with every evil that is now arrived? have we not both
      warned him, and have not the clamours of his creditors assailed him? yet
      what has been the consequence? he has not submitted to the smallest change
      in his way of life, he has not denied himself a single indulgence, nor
      spared any expence, nor thought of any reformation. Luxury has followed
      luxury, and he has only grown fonder of extravagance, as extravagance has
      become more dangerous. Till the present storm, therefore, blows over,
      leave him to his fate, and when a calm succeeds, I will myself, for the
      sake of Priscilla, aid you to save what is possible of the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you say, madam, is as wise as it is good, and now I am acquainted
      with your opinion, I will wholly new model myself upon it, and grow as
      steady against all attacks as hitherto I have been yielding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was then retiring; but again detaining her, he said &ldquo;You spoke,
      madam, of a removal, and indeed it is high time you should quit this
      scene; yet I hope you intend not to go till to-morrow, as Mr Harrel has
      declared your leaving him sooner will be his destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;for I mean to be gone with all the speed
      in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Harrel,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;did not explain himself; but I believe he
      apprehends your deserting his house at this critical time, will raise a
      suspicion of his own design of going abroad, and make his creditors
      interfere to prevent him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what a wretched state,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;has he reduced himself! I will
      not, however, be the voluntary instrument of his disgrace; and if you
      think my stay is so material to his security, I will continue here till
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arnott almost wept his thanks for this concession, and Cecilia, happy
      in making it to him instead of Mr Harrel, then went to her own room, and
      wrote the following letter to Mrs Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To the Hon. Mrs Delvile, St James's-square</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PORTMAN SQUARE, <i>June</i> 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MADAM,&mdash;I am willing to hope you have been rather surprised that
      I have not sooner availed myself of the permission with which you
      yesterday honoured me of spending this whole day with you, but,
      unfortunately for myself, I am prevented waiting upon you even for any
      part of it. Do not, however, think me now ungrateful if I stay away, nor
      to-morrow impertinent, if I venture to enquire whether that apartment
      which you had once the goodness to appropriate to my use, may then again
      be spared for me! The accidents which have prompted this strange request
      will, I trust, be sufficient apology for the liberty I take in making it,
      when I have the honour to see you, and acquaint you what they are.&mdash;I
      am, with the utmost respect, Dear Madam, your most obedient humble
      servant, CECILIA BEVERLEY.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not have been thus concise, had not the caution of Mr Arnott
      made her fear, in the present perilous situation of affairs, to trust the
      secret of Mr Harrel to paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following answer was returned her from Mrs Delvile;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Miss Beverley, Portman-square</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accidents you mention are not, I hope, of a very serious nature, since
      I shall find difficulty insurmountable in trying to lament them, if they
      are productive of a lengthened visit from my dear Miss Beverley to her
      Faithful humble servant, AUGUSTA DELVILE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, charmed with this note, could now no longer forbear looking
      forward to brighter prospects, flattering herself that once under the roof
      of Mrs Delvile, she must necessarily be happy, let the engagements or
      behaviour of her son be what they might.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER x. &mdash; A GAMESTER'S CONSCIENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From this soothing prospect, Cecilia was presently disturbed by Mrs
      Harrel's maid, who came to entreat she would hasten to her lady, whom she
      feared was going into fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia flew to her immediately, and found her in the most violent
      affliction. She used every kind effort in her power to quiet and console
      her, but it was not without the utmost difficulty she could sob out the
      cause of this fresh sorrow, which indeed was not trifling. Mr Harrel, she
      said, had told her he could not possibly raise money even for his
      travelling expences, without risking a discovery of his project, and being
      seized by his creditors; he had therefore charged her, <i>through her
      brother or her friend</i>, to procure for him £3000, as less would not
      suffice to maintain them while abroad, and he knew no method by which he
      could have any remittances without danger. And, when she hesitated in her
      compliance, he furiously accused her of having brought on all this
      distress by her negligence and want of management, and declared that if
      she did not get the money, she would only be served as she merited by
      starving in a foreign gaol, which he swore would be the fate of them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror and indignation with which Cecilia heard this account were
      unspeakable. She saw evidently that she was again to be played upon by
      terror and distress, and the cautions and opinions of Mr Monckton no
      longer appeared overstrained; <i>one year's income</i> was already
      demanded, the annuity and the country house might next be required; she
      rejoiced, however, that thus wisely forewarned, she was not liable to
      surprise, and she determined, be their entreaties or representations what
      they might, to be immovably steady in her purpose of leaving them the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she could not but grieve at suffering the whole burthen of this
      clamorous imposition to fall upon the soft-hearted Mr Arnott, whose
      inability to resist solicitation made him so unequal to sustaining its
      weight; but when Mrs Harrel was again able to go on with her account, she
      heard, to her infinite surprise, that all application to her brother had
      proved fruitless. &ldquo;He will not hear me,&rdquo; continued Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;and he
      never was deaf to me before! so now I have lost my only and last resource,
      my brother himself gives me up, and there is no one else upon earth who
      will assist me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, with readiness, with joy,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;should you find
      assistance from me, were it to you alone it were given; but to supply fuel
      for the very fire that is consuming you&mdash;no, no, my whole heart is
      hardened against gaming and gamesters, and neither now nor ever will I
      suffer any consideration to soften me in their favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel only answered by tears and lamentations; and Cecilia, whose
      justice shut not out compassion, having now declared her purposed
      firmness, again attempted to sooth her, entreating her not to give way to
      such immoderate grief, since better prospects might arise from the very
      gloom now before her, and a short time spent in solitude and oeconomy,
      might enable her to return to her native land with recovered happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall never return!&rdquo; cried she, weeping, &ldquo;I shall die, I shall
      break my heart before I have been banished a month! Oh Miss Beverley, how
      happy are you! able to stay where you please,&mdash;rich,&mdash;rolling in
      wealth which you do not want,&mdash;of which had we but <i>one</i> year's
      income only, all this misery would be over, and we might stay in our dear,
      dear, country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, struck by a hint that so nearly bordered upon reproach, and
      offended by seeing the impossibility of ever doing enough, while anything
      remained to be done, forbore not without difficulty enquiring what next
      was expected from her, and whether any part of her fortune might be
      guarded, without giving room for some censure! but the deep affliction of
      Mrs Harrel soon removed her resentment, and scarcely thinking her, while
      in a state of such wretchedness, answerable for what she said, after a
      little recollection, she mildly replied &ldquo;As affluence is all comparative,
      you may at present think I have more than my share; but the time is only
      this moment past, when your own situation seemed as subject to the envy of
      others as mine may be now. My future destiny is yet undetermined, and the
      occasion I may have for my fortune is unknown to myself; but whether I
      possess it in peace or in turbulence, whether it proves to me a blessing
      or an injury, so long as I can call it my own, I shall always remember
      with alacrity the claim upon that and upon me which early friendship has
      so justly given Mrs Harrel. Yet permit me, at the same time, to add, that
      I do not hold myself so entirely independent as you may probably suppose
      me. I have not, it is true, any Relations to call me to account, but
      respect for their memory supplies the place of their authority, and I
      cannot, in the distribution of the fortune which has devolved to me,
      forbear sometimes considering how they would have wished it should be
      spent, and always remembering that what was acquired by industry and
      labour, should never be dissipated in idleness and vanity. Forgive me for
      thus speaking to the point; you will not find me less friendly to
      yourself, for this frankness with respect to your situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears were again the only answer of Mrs Harrel; yet Cecilia, who pitied
      the weakness of her mind, stayed by her with the most patient kindness
      till the servants announced dinner. She then declared she would not go
      down stairs; but Cecilia so strongly represented the danger of awakening
      suspicion in the servants, that she at last prevailed with her to make her
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel was already in the parlour, and enquiring for Mr Arnott, but was
      told by the servants he had sent word he had another engagement. Sir
      Robert Floyer also kept away, and, for the first time since her arrival in
      town, Cecilia dined with no other company than the master and mistress of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel could eat nothing; Cecilia, merely to avoid creating surprise
      in the servants, forbore following her example; but Mr Harrel ate much as
      usual, talked all dinner-time, was extremely civil to Cecilia, and
      discovered not by his manners the least alteration in his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servants were gone, he desired his wife to step for a moment with
      him into the library. They soon returned, and then Mr Harrel, after
      walking in a disordered manner about the room, rang the bell, and ordered
      his hat and cane, and as he took them, said &ldquo;If this fails&mdash;&rdquo; and,
      stopping short, without speaking to his wife, or even bowing to Cecilia,
      he hastily went out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel told Cecilia that he had merely called her to know the event of
      her two petitions, and had heard her double failure in total silence.
      Whither he was now gone it was not easy to conjecture, nor what was the
      new resource which he still seemed to think worth trying; but the manner
      of his quitting the house, and the threat implied by <i>if this fails</i>,
      contributed not to lessen the grief of Mrs Harrel, and gave to Cecilia
      herself the utmost alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued together till tea-time, the servants having been ordered to
      admit no company. Mr Harrel himself then returned, and returned, to the
      amazement of Cecilia, accompanied by Mr Marriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presented that young man to both the ladies as a gentleman whose
      acquaintance and friendship he was very desirous to cultivate. Mrs Harrel,
      too much absorbed in her own affairs to care about any other, saw his
      entrance with a momentary surprise, and then thought of it no more; but it
      was not so with Cecilia, whose better understanding led her to deeper
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the visits of Mr Marriot but a few weeks since Mr Harrel had
      prohibited, yet he now introduced him into his house with particular
      distinction; he came back too himself in admirable spirits, enlivened in
      his countenance, and restored to his good humour. A change so
      extraordinary both in conduct and disposition convinced her that some
      change no less extra-ordinary of circumstance must previously have
      happened; what that might be it was not possible for her to divine, but
      the lessons she had received from Mr Monckton led her to suspicions of the
      darkest kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every part of his behaviour served still further to confirm them; he was
      civil even to excess to Mr Marriot; he gave orders aloud not to be at home
      to Sir Robert Floyer; he made his court to Cecilia with unusual assiduity,
      and he took every method in his power to procure opportunity to her
      admirer of addressing and approaching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who seemed <i>enamoured even to madness</i>, could scarce
      refrain not merely from prostration to the object of his passion, but to
      Mr Harrel himself for permitting him to see her. Cecilia, who not without
      some concern perceived a fondness so fruitless, and who knew not by what
      arts or with what views Mr Harrel might think proper to encourage it,
      determined to take all the means that were in her own power towards giving
      it immediate control. She behaved, therefore, with the utmost reserve, and
      the moment tea was over, though earnestly entreated to remain with them,
      she retired to her own room, without making any other apology than coldly
      saying she could not stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour Mrs Harrel ran up stairs to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Miss Beverley,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;a little respite is now granted me! Mr
      Harrel says he shall stay another day; he says, too, one single thousand
      pound would now make him a new man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia returned no answer; she conjectured some new deceit was in
      agitation to raise money, and she feared Mr Marriot was the next dupe to
      be played upon. Mrs Harrel, therefore, with a look of the utmost
      disappointment, left her, saying she would send for her brother, and once
      more try if he had yet any remaining regard for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia rested quiet till eleven o'clock, when she was summoned to supper;
      she found Mr Marriot still the only guest, and that Mr Arnott made not his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now resolved to publish her resolution of going the next morning to St
      James's-square. As soon, therefore, as the servants withdrew, she enquired
      of Mr Harrel if he had any commands with Mr or Mrs Delvile, as she should
      see them the next morning, and purposed to spend some time with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel, with a look of much alarm, asked if she meant the whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many days, she answered, and probably some months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel exclaimed her surprise aloud, and Mr Harrel looked aghast;
      while his new young friend cast upon him a glance of reproach and
      resentment, which fully convinced Cecilia he imagined he had procured
      himself a title to an easiness of intercourse and frequency of meeting
      which this intelligence destroyed. Cecilia, thinking after all that had
      passed, no other ceremony on her part was necessary but that of simply
      speaking her intention, then arose and returned to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She acquainted her maid that she was going to make a visit to Mrs Delvile,
      and gave her directions about packing up her clothes, and sending for a
      man in the morning to take care of her books.
    </p>
    <p>
      This employment was soon interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Harrel, who
      desiring to speak with her alone, when the maid was gone, said &ldquo;O Miss
      Beverley, can you indeed be so barbarous as to leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you, Mrs Harrel,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;to save both yourself and
      me any further discussions. I have delayed this removal very long, and I
      can now delay it no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel then flung herself upon a chair in the bitterest sorrow,
      declaring she was utterly undone; that Mr Harrel had declared he could not
      stay even an hour in England if she was not in his house; that he had
      already had a violent quarrel with Mr Marriot upon the subject; and that
      her brother, though she had sent him the most earnest entreaties, would
      not come near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, tired of vain attempts to offer comfort, now urged the warmest
      expostulations against her opposition, strongly representing the real
      necessity of her going abroad, and the unpardonable weakness of wishing to
      continue such a life as she now led, adding debt to debt, and hoarding
      distress upon distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel then, though rather from compulsion than conviction, declared
      she would agree to go, if she had not a dread of ill usage; but Mr Harrel,
      she said, had behaved to her with the utmost brutality, calling her the
      cause of his ruin, and threatening that if she procured not this thousand
      pound before the ensuing evening, she should be treated as she deserved
      for her extravagance and folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he think, then,&rdquo; said Cecilia with the utmost indignation, &ldquo;that I
      am to be frightened through your fears into what compliances he pleases?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;no; his expectations are all from my brother.
      He surely thought that when I supplicated and pleaded to him, he would do
      what I wished, for so he always did formerly, and so once again I am sure
      he would do now, could I but make him come to me, and tell him how I am
      used, and tell him that if Mr Harrel takes me abroad in this humour, I
      verily think in his rage he will half murder me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who well knew she was herself the real cause of Mr Arnott's
      resistance, now felt her resolution waver, internally reproaching herself
      with the sufferings of his sister; alarmed, however, for her own
      constancy, she earnestly besought Mrs Harrel to go and compose herself for
      the night, and promised to deliberate what could be done for her before
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel complied; but scarce was her own rest more broken than that of
      Cecilia, who, though extremely fatigued with a whole night's watching, was
      so perturbed in her mind she could not close her eyes. Mrs Harrel was her
      earliest, and had once been her dearest friend; she had deprived her by
      her own advice of her customary refuge in her brother; to refuse,
      therefore, assistance to her seemed cruelty, though to deny it to Mr
      Harrel was justice; she endeavoured, therefore, to make a compromise
      between her judgment and compassion, by resolving that though she would
      grant nothing further to Mr Harrel while he remained in London, she would
      contribute from time to time both to his necessities and comfort, when
      once he was established elsewhere upon some plan of prudence and economy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER xi. &mdash; A PERSECUTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning by five o'clock Mrs Harrel came into Cecilia's room to
      know the result of her deliberation; and Cecilia, with that graceful
      readiness which accompanied all her kind offices, instantly assured her
      the thousand pound should be her own, if she would consent to seek some
      quiet retreat, and receive it in small sums, of fifty or one hundred
      pounds at a time, which should be carefully transmitted, and which, by
      being delivered to herself, might secure better treatment from Mr Harrel,
      and be a motive to revive his care and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flew, much delighted, with this proposal to her husband; but
      presently, and with a dejected look, returning, said Mr Harrel protested
      he could not possibly set out without first receiving the money. &ldquo;I shall
      go myself, therefore,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to my brother after breakfast, for he
      will not, I see, unkind as he is grown, come to me; and if I do not
      succeed with him, I believe I shall never come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Cecilia, offended and disappointed, answered &ldquo;I am sorry for Mr
      Arnott, but for myself I have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel then left her, and she arose to make immediate preparations for
      her removal to St James's-square, whither, with all the speed in her
      power, she sent her books, her trunks, and all that belonged to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was summoned down stairs, she found, for the first time, Mr
      Harrel breakfasting at the same table with his wife; they seemed mutually
      out of humour and comfortless, nothing hardly was spoken, and little was
      swallowed; Mr Harrel, however, was civil, but his wife was totally silent,
      and Cecilia the whole time was planning how to take her leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tea things were removed, Mr Harrel said, &ldquo;You have not, I hope,
      Miss Beverley, quite determined upon this strange scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have, Sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and already I have sent my clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this information he seemed thunderstruck; but, after somewhat
      recovering, said with much bitterness, &ldquo;Well, madam, at least may I
      request you will stay here till the evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; answered she coolly, &ldquo;I am going instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you not,&rdquo; said he, with yet greater asperity, &ldquo;amuse yourself
      first with seeing bailiffs take possession of my house, and your friend
      Priscilla follow me to jail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Mr Harrel!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, with uplifted hands, &ldquo;is this a
      question, is this behaviour I have merited!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no!&rdquo; cried he with quickness, &ldquo;should I once think that way&mdash;&rdquo;
       then rising and striking his forehead, he walked about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel arose too, and weeping violently went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you at least,&rdquo; said Cecilia, when she was gone, &ldquo;till your affairs
      are settled, leave Priscilla with me? When I go into my own house, she
      shall accompany me, and mean time Mr Arnott's I am sure will gladly be
      open to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;she deserves no such indulgence; she has not any
      reason to complain, she has been as negligent, as profuse, as expensive as
      myself; she has practised neither oeconomy nor self-denial, she has neither
      thought of me nor my affairs, nor is she now afflicted at any thing but
      the loss of that affluence she has done her best towards diminishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All recrimination,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;were vain, or what might not Mrs
      Harrel urge in return! but let us not enlarge upon so ungrateful a
      subject, the wisest and the happiest scheme now were mutually and kindly
      to console each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consolation and kindness,&rdquo; cried he, with abruptness, &ldquo;are out of the
      question. I have ordered a post chaise to be here at night, and if till
      then you will stay, I will promise to release you without further petition
      if not, eternal destruction be my portion if I <i>live</i> to see the
      scene which your removal will occasion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My removal,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, shuddering, &ldquo;good heaven, and how can my
      removal be of such dreadful consequence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me not,&rdquo; cried he, fiercely, &ldquo;questions or reasons now; the crisis is
      at hand, and you will soon, happen what may, know all; mean time what I
      have said is a fact, and immutable; and you must hasten my end, or give me
      a chance for avoiding it, as you think fit. I scarce care at this instant
      which way you decide; remember, however, all I ask of you is to defer your
      departure; what else I have to hope is from Mr Arnott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now was again a coward! In vain she called to her support the
      advice, the prophesies, the cautions of Mr Monckton, in vain she
      recollected the impositions she had already seen practised, for neither
      the warnings of her counsellor, nor the lessons of her own experience,
      were proofs against the terrors which threats so desperate inspired; and
      though more than once she determined to fly at all events from a tyranny
      he had so little right to usurp, the mere remembrance of the words <i>if
      you stay not till night I will not live</i>, robbed her of all courage;
      and however long she had prepared herself for this very attack, when the
      moment arrived, its power over her mind was too strong for resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conflict between fear and resolution was still undecided, her
      servant brought her the following letter from Mr Arnott.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Miss Beverley, Portman-square. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      June 13th, 1779.
    </p>
    <p>
      MADAM,&mdash;Determined to obey those commands which you had the goodness
      to honour me with, I have absented myself from town till Mr Harrel is
      settled; for though I am as sensible of your wisdom as of your beauty, I
      find myself too weak to bear the distress of my unhappy sister, and
      therefore I run from the sight, nor shall any letter or message follow me,
      unless it comes from Miss Beverley herself, lest she should in future
      refuse the only favour I dare presume to solicit, that of sometimes
      deigning to honour with her directions, the most humble and devoted of her
      servants, J. ARNOTT.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of her apprehensions for herself and her own interest,
      Cecilia could not forbear rejoicing that Mr Arnott, at least, had escaped
      the present storm; yet she was certain it would fall the more heavily upon
      herself; and dreaded the sight of Mrs Harrel after the shock which this
      flight would occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her expectations were but too quickly fulfilled; Mrs Harrel in a short
      time after rushed wildly into the room, calling out &ldquo;My brother is gone!
      he has left me for ever! Oh save me, Miss Beverley, save me from abuse and
      insult!&rdquo; And she wept with so much violence she could utter nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, quite tortured by this persecution, faintly asked what she could
      do for her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;to my brother, and beseech him not to abandon me! send
      to him, and conjure him to advance this thousand pound!&mdash;the chaise
      is already ordered,&mdash;Mr Harrel is fixed upon going,&mdash;yet he says
      without that money we must both starve in a strange land,&mdash;O send to
      my cruel brother! he has left word that nothing must follow him that does
      not come from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the world, then,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;would I not baffle his discretion!
      indeed you must submit to your fate, indeed Mrs Harrel you must endeavour
      to bear it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, shedding a flood of tears, declared she would try to follow
      her advice, but again besought her in the utmost agony to send after her
      brother, protesting she did not think even her life would be safe in
      making so long a journey with Mr Harrel in his present state of mind; his
      character, she said, was totally changed, his gaiety, good humour, and
      sprightliness were turned into roughness and moroseness, and, since his
      great losses at play, he was grown so fierce and furious, that to oppose
      him even in a trifle, rendered him quite outrageous in passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though truly concerned, and almost melted, yet refused to
      interfere with Mr Arnott, and even thought it but justice to acknowledge
      she had advised his retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you have been so cruel?&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, with still encreasing
      violence of sorrow, &ldquo;to rob me of my only friend, to deprive me of my
      Brother's affection, at the very time I am forced out of the kingdom, with
      a husband who is ready to murder me, and who says he hates the sight of
      me, and all because I cannot get him this fatal, fatal money!&mdash;O Miss
      Beverley, how could I have thought to have had such an office from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was beginning a justification, when a message came from Mr Harrel,
      desiring to see his wife immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, in great terror, cast herself at Cecilia's feet, and clinging
      to her knees, called out &ldquo;I dare not go to him! I dare not go to him! he
      wants to know my success, and when he hears my brother is run away, I am
      sure he will kill me!&mdash;Oh Miss Beverley, how could you send him away?
      how could you be so inhuman as to leave me to the rage of Mr Harrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, distressed and trembling herself, conjured her to rise and be
      consoled; but Mrs Harrel, weak and frightened, could only weep and
      supplicate; &ldquo;I don't ask you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to give the money yourself, but
      only to send for my brother, that he may protect me, and beg Mr Harrel not
      to treat me so cruelly,&mdash;consider but what a long, long journey I am
      going to make! consider how often you used to say you would love me for
      ever! consider you have robbed me of the tenderest brother in the world!&mdash;Oh
      Miss Beverley, send for him back, or be a sister to me yourself, and let
      not your poor Priscilla leave her native land without help or pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, wholly overcome, now knelt too, and embracing her with tears,
      said &ldquo;Oh Priscilla, plead and reproach no more! what you wish shall be
      yours,&mdash;I will send for your brother,&mdash;I will do what you
      please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are my friend indeed!&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;let me but <i>see</i>
      my brother, and his heart will yield to my distress, and he will soften Mr
      Harrel by giving his unhappy sister this parting bounty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then took a pen in her hand to write to Mr Arnott; but struck
      almost in the same moment with a notion of treachery in calling him from a
      retreat which her own counsel made him seek, professedly to expose him to
      a supplication which from his present situation might lead him to ruin,
      she hastily flung it from her, and exclaimed &ldquo;No, excellent Mr Arnott, I
      will not so unworthily betray you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you, Miss Beverley, can you at last,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;be so
      barbarous as to retract?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my poor Priscilla,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;I cannot so cruelly disappoint
      you; my pity shall however make no sufferer but myself,&mdash;I cannot
      send for Mr Arnott,&mdash;from me you must have the money, and may it
      answer the purpose for which it is given, and restore to you the
      tenderness of your husband, and the peace of your own heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Priscilla, scarce waiting to thank her, flew with this intelligence to Mr
      Harrel; who with the same impetuosity, scarce waiting to say he was glad
      of it, ran himself to bring the Jew from whom the money was to be
      procured. Every thing was soon settled, Cecilia had no time for
      retracting, and repentance they had not the delicacy to regard; again,
      therefore, she signed her name for paying the principal and interest of
      another 1000<i>l</i>. within ten days after she was of age; and having
      taken the money, she accompanied Mr and Mrs Harrel into another room.
      Presenting it then with an affecting solemnity to Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;accept,
      Priscilla,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this irrefragable mark of the sincerity of my
      friendship; but suffer me at the same time to tell you, it is the last to
      so considerable an amount I ever mean to offer; receive it, therefore,
      with kindness, but use it with discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then embraced her, and eager now to avoid acknowledgment, as before
      she had been to escape importunities, she left them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soothing recompense of succouring benevolence, followed not this gift,
      nor made amends for this loss; perplexity and uneasiness, regret and
      resentment, accompanied the donation, and rested upon her mind; she feared
      she had done wrong; she was certain Mr Monckton would blame her; he knew
      not the persecution she suffered, nor would he make any allowance for the
      threats which alarmed, or the intreaties which melted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far other had been her feelings at the generosity she exerted for the
      Hills; no doubts then tormented her, and no repentance embittered her
      beneficence. Their worth was without suspicion, and their misfortunes were
      not of their own seeking; the post in which they had been stationed they
      had never deserted, and the poverty into which they had sunk was
      accidental and unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, every evil had been wantonly incurred by vanity and
      licentiousness, and shamelessly followed by injustice and fraud; the
      disturbance of her mind only increased by reflection, for when the rights
      of the creditors with their injuries occurred to her, she enquired of
      herself by what title or equity, she had so liberally assisted Mr Harrel
      in eluding their claims, and flying the punishment which the law would
      inflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled by this consideration, she most severely reproached herself for a
      compliance of which she had so lightly weighed the consequences, and
      thought with the utmost dismay, that while she had flattered herself she
      was merely indulging the dictates of humanity, she might perhaps be
      accused by the world as an abettor of guile and injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;whom can I essentially have injured but myself?
      would his creditors have been benefitted by my refusal? had I braved the
      execution of his dreadful threat, and quitted his house before I was
      wrought upon to assist him, would his suicide have lessened their losses,
      or secured their demands? even if he had no intention but to intimidate
      me, who will be wronged by my enabling him to go abroad, or who would be
      better paid were he seized and confined? All that remains of his shattered
      fortune may still be claimed, though I have saved him from a lingering
      imprisonment, desperate for himself and his wife, and useless for those he
      has plundered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, now soothed by the purity of her intentions, and now uneasy from
      the rectitude of her principles, she alternately rejoiced and repined at
      what she had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Mr Harrel was all civility and good humour. He warmly thanked
      Cecilia for the kindness she had shewn him, and gaily added, &ldquo;You should
      be absolved from all the mischief you may do for a twelvemonth to come, in
      reward for the preservation from mischief which you have this day
      effected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The preservation,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;will I hope be for many days. But tell
      me, sir, exactly, at what time I may acquaint Mrs Delvile I shall wait
      upon her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;by eight o'clock; perhaps by nine; you will not
      mind half an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not;&rdquo; she answered, unwilling by disputing about a trifle to
      diminish his satisfaction in her assistance. She wrote, therefore, another
      note to Mrs Delvile, desiring she would not expect her till near ten
      o'clock, and promising to account and apologize for these seeming caprices
      when she had the honour of seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the afternoon she spent wholly in exhorting Mrs Harrel to shew
      more fortitude, and conjuring her to study nothing while abroad but
      oeconomy, prudence and housewifery; a lesson how hard for the thoughtless
      and negligent Priscilla! she heard the advice with repugnance, and only
      answered it with helpless complaints that she knew not how to spend less
      money than she had always done.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea, Mr Harrel, still in high spirits, went out, entreating Cecilia
      to stay with Priscilla till his return, which he promised should be early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o'clock, however, came, and he did not appear; Cecilia then grew
      anxious to keep her appointment with Mrs Delvile; but ten o'clock also
      came, and still Mr Harrel was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then determined to wait no longer, and rang her bell for her servant
      and chair; but when Mrs Harrel desired to be informed the moment that Mr
      Harrel returned, the man said he had been come home more than half an
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much surprised, she enquired where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his own room, madam, and gave orders not to be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who was not much pleased at this account, was easily persuaded to
      stay a few minutes longer; and, fearing some new evil, she was going to
      send him a message, by way of knowing how he was employed, when he came
      himself into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ladies,&rdquo; he cried in a hurrying manner, &ldquo;who is for Vauxhall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vauxhall!&rdquo; repeated Mrs Harrel, while Cecilia, staring, perceived in his
      face a look of perturbation that extremely alarmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we have no time to lose. A hackney coach will
      serve us; we won't wait for our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you then given up going abroad?&rdquo; said Mrs Harrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; where can we go from half so well? let us live while we live! I
      have ordered a chaise to be in waiting there. Come, let's be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;let me wish you both good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not go with me?&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;how can I go to Vauxhall
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not alone,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;but if I go, how am I to return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall return with you,&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, &ldquo;if you desire it; you shall
      return together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, starting up in rapture, called out &ldquo;Oh Mr Harrel, will you
      indeed leave me in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he reproachfully, &ldquo;if you will make a better friend than
      you have made a wife, and if Miss Beverley is content to take charge of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can all this mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, &ldquo;is it possible you can be
      serious? Are you really going yourself, and will you suffer Mrs Harrel to
      remain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ringing the bell, he ordered a hackney coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel was scarce able to breathe for extacy, nor Cecilia for
      amazement; while Mr Harrel, attending to neither of them, walked for some
      time silently about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; cried Cecilia at last, &ldquo;can I possibly go? Mrs Delvile must
      already be astonished at my delay, and if I disappoint her again she will
      hardly receive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O make not any difficulties,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel in an agony; &ldquo;if Mr Harrel
      will let me stay, sure you will not be so cruel as to oppose him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;should either of us go to Vauxhall? surely that
      is no place for a parting so melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant then came in, and said the hackney coach was at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel, starting at the sound, called out, &ldquo;come, what do we wait for?
      if we go not immediately, we may be prevented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then again wished them good night, protesting she could fail Mrs
      Delvile no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, half wild at this refusal, conjured her in the most frantic
      manner, to give way, exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh cruel! cruel! to deny me this last
      request! I will kneel to you day and night,&rdquo; sinking upon the ground
      before her, &ldquo;and I will serve you as the humblest of your slaves, if you
      will but be kind in this last instance, and save me from banishment and
      misery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh rise, Mrs Harrel,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, ashamed of her prostration, and
      shocked by her vehemence, &ldquo;rise and let me rest!&mdash;it is painful to me
      to refuse, but to comply for ever in defiance of my judgment&mdash;Oh Mrs
      Harrel, I know no longer what is kind or what is cruel, nor have I known
      for some time past right from wrong, nor good from evil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel impetuously, &ldquo;I wait not another minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave her then with me!&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;I will perform my promise, Mr
      Arnott will I am sure hold his to be sacred, she shall now go with him,
      she shall hereafter come to me,&mdash;leave her but behind, and depend
      upon our care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried he, with quickness, &ldquo;I must take care of her myself. I
      shall not carry her abroad with me, but the only legacy I can leave her,
      is a warning which I hope she will remember for ever. <i>You</i>, however,
      need not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;leave me at Vauxhall, and yet leave me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that?&rdquo; cried he with fierceness, &ldquo;do you not desire to be left?
      have you any regard for me? or for any thing upon earth but yourself!
      cease these vain clamours, and come, I insist upon it, this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a violent oath, he declared he would be detained no longer,
      and approached in great rage to seize her; Mrs Harrel shrieked aloud, and
      the terrified Cecilia exclaimed, &ldquo;If indeed you are to part to-night, part
      not thus dreadfully!&mdash;rise, Mrs Harrel, and comply!&mdash;be
      reconciled, be kind to her, Mr Harrel!&mdash;and I will go with her
      myself,&mdash;we will all go together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, more gently yet with the utmost emotion, &ldquo;why
      should <i>you</i> go!&mdash;<i>you</i> want no warning! <i>you</i> need no
      terror!&mdash;better far had you fly us, and my wife when I am set out may
      find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, however, suffered her not to recede; and Cecilia, though half
      distracted by the scenes of horror and perplexity in which she was
      perpetually engaged, ordered her servant to acquaint Mrs Delvile she was
      again compelled to defer waiting upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel then hurried them both into the coach, which he directed to
      Vauxhall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray write to me when you are landed,&rdquo; said Mrs Harrel, who now released
      from her personal apprehensions, began to feel some for her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made not any answer. She then asked to what part of France he meant to
      go; but still he did not reply; and when she urged him by a third
      question, he told her in a rage to torment him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the rest of the ride not another word was said; Mrs Harrel wept,
      her husband guarded a gloomy silence, and Cecilia most unpleasantly passed
      her time between anxious suspicions of some new scheme, and a terrified
      wonder in what all these transactions would terminate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER xii. &mdash; A MAN OF BUSINESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they entered Vauxhall, Mr Harrel endeavoured to dismiss his
      moroseness, and affecting his usual gaiety, struggled to recover his
      spirits; but the effort was vain, he could neither talk nor look like
      himself, and though from time to time he resumed his air of wonted levity,
      he could not support it, but drooped and hung his head in evident
      despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made them take several turns in the midst of the company, and walked so
      fast that they could hardly keep pace with him, as if he hoped by exercise
      to restore his vivacity; but every attempt failed, he sunk and grew
      sadder, and muttering between his teeth &ldquo;this is not to be borne!&rdquo; he
      hastily called to a waiter to bring him a bottle of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this he drank glass after glass, notwithstanding Cecilia, as Mrs Harrel
      had not courage to speak, entreated him to forbear. He seemed, however,
      not to hear her; but when he had drunk what he thought necessary to revive
      him, he conveyed them into an unfrequented part of the garden, and as soon
      as they were out of sight of all but a few stragglers, he suddenly stopt,
      and, in great agitation, said, &ldquo;my chaise will soon be ready, and I shall
      take of you a long farewell!&mdash;all my affairs are unpropitious to my
      speedy return;&mdash;the wine is now mounting into my head, and perhaps I
      may not be able to say much by and by. I fear I have been cruel to you,
      Priscilla, and I begin to wish I had spared you this parting scene; yet
      let it not be banished your remembrance, but think of it when you are
      tempted to such mad folly as has ruined us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel wept too much to make any answer; and turning from her to
      Cecilia, &ldquo;Oh Madam,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to <i>you</i>, indeed, I dare not speak! I
      have used you most unworthily, but I pay for it all! I ask you not to pity
      or forgive me, I know it is impossible you should do either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried the softened Cecilia, &ldquo;it is not impossible, I do both at this
      moment, and I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not hope,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;be not so angelic, for I cannot bear it!
      benevolence like yours should have fallen into worthier hands. But come,
      let us return to the company. My head grows giddy, but my heart is still
      heavy; I must make them more fit companions for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would then have hurried them back; but Cecilia, endeavouring to stop
      him, said &ldquo;You do not mean, I hope, to call for more wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried he, with affected spirit, &ldquo;what, shall we not be merry
      before we part? Yes, we will all be merry, for if we are not, how shall we
      part at all?&mdash;Oh not without a struggle!&mdash;&rdquo; Then, stopping, he
      paused a moment, and casting off the mask of levity, said in accents the
      most solemn &ldquo;I commit this packet to <i>you</i>,&rdquo; giving a sealed parcel
      to Cecilia; &ldquo;had I written it later, its contents had been kinder to my
      wife, for now the hour of separation approaches, ill will and resentment
      subside. Poor Priscilla!&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;but you will succour her,
      I am sure you will,&mdash;Oh had I known you myself before this
      infatuation&mdash;bright pattern of all goodness!&mdash;but I was devoted,&mdash;a
      ruined wretch before ever you entered my house; unworthy to be saved,
      unworthy that virtues such as yours should dwell under the same roof with
      me! But come,&mdash;come now, or my resolution will waver, and I shall not
      go at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this packet?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;and why do you give it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, no matter, you will know by and by;&mdash;the chaise waits,
      and I must gather courage to be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then pressed forward, answering neither to remonstrance nor intreaty
      from his frightened companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment they returned to the covered walk, they were met by Mr Marriot;
      Mr Harrel, starting, endeavoured to pass him; but when he approached, and
      said &ldquo;you have sent, Sir, no answer to my letter!&rdquo; he stopt, and in a tone
      of forced politeness, said, &ldquo;No, Sir, but I shall answer it to-morrow, and
      to-night I hope you will do me the honour of supping with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Marriot, looking openly at Cecilia as his inducement, though evidently
      regarding himself as an injured man, hesitated a moment, yet accepted the
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To supper?&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;what here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To supper?&rdquo; repeated Cecilia, &ldquo;and how are we to get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of that these two hours,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;come, let us look for a
      box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then grew quite urgent with him to give up a scheme which must
      keep them so late, and Mrs Harrel repeatedly exclaimed &ldquo;Indeed people will
      think it very odd to see us here without any party;&rdquo; but he heeded them
      not, and perceiving at some distance Mr Morrice, he called out to him to
      find them a box; for the evening was very pleasant, and the gardens were
      so much crowded that no accommodation was unseized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Morrice, with his usual readiness, &ldquo;I'll get you one if I
      turn out ten old Aldermen sucking custards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just after he was gone, a fat, sleek, vulgar-looking man, dressed in a
      bright purple coat, with a deep red waistcoat, and a wig bulging far from
      his head with small round curls, while his plump face and person announced
      plenty and good living, and an air of defiance spoke the fullness of his
      purse, strutted boldly up to Mr Harrel, and accosting him in a manner that
      shewed some diffidence of his reception, but none of his right, said &ldquo;Sir
      your humble servant.&rdquo; And made a bow first to him, and then to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir yours,&rdquo; replied Mr Harrel scornfully, and without touching his hat he
      walked quickly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fat acquaintance, who seemed but little disposed to be offended with
      impunity, instantly replaced his hat on his head, and with a look that
      implied <i>I'll fit you for this!</i> put his hands to his sides, and
      following him, said &ldquo;Sir, I must make bold to beg the favour of exchanging
      a few words with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Sir,&rdquo; answered Mr Harrel, &ldquo;come to me to-morrow, and you shall
      exchange as many as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like the time present, Sir,&rdquo; answered the man; &ldquo;as for to-morrow,
      I believe it intends to come no more; for I have heard of it any time
      these three years. I mean no reflections, Sir, but let every man have his
      right. That's what I say, and that's my notion of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel, with a violent execration, asked what he meant by dunning him
      at such a place as Vauxhall?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One place, Sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is as good as another place; for so as what
      one does is good, 'tis no matter for where it may be. A <i>man of business</i>
      never wants a counter if he can meet with a joint-stool. For my part, I'm
      all for a clear conscience, and no bills without receipts to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you were all for broken bones,&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, angrily, &ldquo;I would
      oblige you with them without delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the man, equally provoked, &ldquo;this is talking quite out of
      character, for as to broken bones, there's ne'er a person in all England,
      gentle nor simple, can say he's a right to break mine, for I'm not a
      person of that sort, but a man of as good property as another man; and
      there's ne'er a customer I have in the world that's more his own man than
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless me, Mr Hobson,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;don't follow us in this
      manner! If we meet any of our acquaintance they'll think us half crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; answered Mr Hobson, again taking off his hat, &ldquo;if I'm treated
      with proper respect, no man will behave more generous than myself; but if
      I'm affronted, all I can say is, it may go harder with some folks than
      they think for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a little mean-looking man, very thin, and almost bent double with
      perpetual cringing, came up to Mr Hobson, and pulling him by the sleeve,
      whispered, yet loud enough to be heard, &ldquo;It's surprizeable to me, Mr
      Hobson, you can behave so out of the way! For my part, perhaps I've as
      much my due as another person, but I dares to say I shall have it when
      it's convenient, and I'd scorn for to mislest a gentleman when he's taking
      his pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless me,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel, &ldquo;what shall we do now? here's all Mr
      Harrel's creditors coming upon us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, re-assuming an air of gaiety, &ldquo;why give them all a
      supper, to be sure. Come, gentlemen, will you favour me with your company
      to supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Mr Hobson, somewhat softened by this unexpected
      invitation, &ldquo;I've supped this hour and more, and had my glass too, for I'm
      as willing to spend my money as another man; only what I say is this, I
      don't chuse to be cheated, for that's losing one's substance, and getting
      no credit; however, as to drinking another glass, or such a matter as
      that, I'll do it with all the pleasure in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as to me,&rdquo; said the other man, whose name was Simkins, and whose head
      almost touched the ground by the profoundness of his reverence, &ldquo;I can't
      upon no account think of taking the liberty; but if I may just stand
      without, I'll make bold to go so far as just for to drink my humble duty
      to the ladies in a cup of cyder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Mr Harrel, are you mad!&rdquo; cried his wife, &ldquo;to think of asking
      such people as these to supper? what will every body say? suppose any of
      our acquaintance should see us? I am sure I shall die with shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; repeated he, &ldquo;no, not mad but merry. O ho, Mr Morrice, why have you
      been so long? what have you done for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Sir,&rdquo; answered Morrice, returning with a look somewhat less elated
      than he had set out, &ldquo;the gardens are so full, there is not a box to be
      had; but I hope we shall get one for all that; for I observed one of the
      best boxes in the garden, just to the right there, with nobody in it but
      that gentleman who made me spill the tea-pot at the Pantheon. So I made an
      apology, and told him the case; but he only said <i>humph?</i> and <i>hay?</i>
      so then I told it all over again, but he served me just the same, for he
      never seems to hear what one says till one's just done, and then he begins
      to recollect one's speaking to him; however, though I repeated it all over
      and over again, I could get nothing from him but just that <i>humph?</i>
      and <i>hay?</i> but he is so remarkably absent, that I dare say if we all
      go and sit down round him, he won't know a word of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't he?&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, &ldquo;have at him, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he followed Mr Morrice, though Cecilia, who now half suspected that
      all was to end in a mere idle frolic, warmly joined her remonstrances to
      those of Mrs Harrel, which were made with the utmost, but with fruitless
      earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, who was seated in the middle of the box, was lolloping upon
      the table with his customary ease, and picking his teeth with his usual
      inattention to all about him. The intrusion, however, of so large a party,
      seemed to threaten his insensibility with unavoidable disturbance; though
      imagining they meant but to look in at the box, and pass on, he made not
      at their first approach any alteration in his attitude or employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, ladies,&rdquo; cried the officious Morrice, &ldquo;I told you there was room;
      and I am sure this gentleman will be very happy to make way for you, if
      it's only out of good-nature to the waiters, as he is neither eating nor
      drinking, nor doing any thing at all. So if you two ladies will go in at
      that side, Mr Harrel and that other gentleman,&rdquo; pointing to Mr Marriot,
      &ldquo;may go to the other, and then I'll sit by the ladies here, and those
      other two gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Meadows, raising himself from his reclining posture, and staring
      Morrice in the face, gravely said, &ldquo;What's all this, Sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrice, who expected to have arranged the whole party without a question,
      and who understood so little of modish airs as to suspect neither
      affectation nor trick in the absence of mind and indolence of manners
      which he observed in Mr Meadows, was utterly amazed by this interrogatory,
      and staring himself in return, said, &ldquo;Sir, you seemed so thoughtful&mdash;I
      did not think&mdash;I did not suppose you would have taken any notice of
      just a person or two coming into the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you, Sir?&rdquo; said Mr Meadows very coldly, &ldquo;why then now you do,
      perhaps you'll be so obliging as to let me have my own box to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then again he returned to his favourite position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, bowing; &ldquo;I am sure I did not mean to
      disturb you; for you seemed so lost in thought, that I'm sure I did not
      much believe you would have seen us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, strutting forward, &ldquo;if I may speak my opinion,
      I should think, as you happen to be quite alone, a little agreeable
      company would be no such bad thing. At least that's my notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I might take the liberty,&rdquo; said the smooth tongued Mr Simkins,
      &ldquo;for to put in a word, I should think the best way would be, if the
      gentleman has no peticklar objection, for me just to stand somewhere
      hereabouts, and so, when he's had what he's a mind to, be ready for to pop
      in at one side, as he comes out at the t'other; for if one does not look
      pretty 'cute such a full night as this, a box is whipt away before one
      knows where one is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; cried Mrs Harrel impatiently, &ldquo;let us neither sup in this
      box nor in any other; let us go away entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we must! indeed we ought!&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;it is utterly improper
      we should stay; pray let us be gone immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel paid not the least regard to these requests; but Mr Meadows, who
      could no longer seem unconscious of what passed, did himself so much
      violence as to arise, and ask if the ladies would be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said so!&rdquo; cried Morrice triumphantly, &ldquo;I was sure there was no
      gentleman but would be happy to accommodate two such ladies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, however, far from happy in being so accommodated, again tried
      their utmost influence in persuading Mr Harrel to give up this scheme; but
      he would not hear them, he insisted upon their going into the box, and,
      extending the privilege which Mr Meadows had given, he invited without
      ceremony the whole party to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, though he seemed to think this a very extraordinary
      encroachment, had already made such an effort from his general languor in
      the repulse he had given to Morrice, that he could exert himself no
      further; but after looking around him with mingled vacancy and contempt,
      he again seated himself, and suffered Morrice to do the honours without
      more opposition. Morrice, but too happy in the office, placed Cecilia next
      to Mr Meadows, and would have made Mr Marriot her other neighbour, but she
      insisted upon not being parted from Mrs Harrel, and therefore, as he chose
      to sit also by that lady himself, Mr Marriot was obliged to follow Mr
      Harrel to the other side of the box; Mr Hobson, without further
      invitation, placed himself comfortably in one of the corners, and Mr
      Simkins, who stood modestly for some time in another, finding the further
      encouragement for which he waited was not likely to arrive, dropt quietly
      into his seat without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was now ordered, and while it was preparing Mr Harrel sat totally
      silent; but Mr Meadows thought proper to force himself to talk with
      Cecilia, though she could well have dispensed with such an exertion of his
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like this place, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I hardly know,&mdash;I never was here before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder! the only surprise is that any body can come to it at all. To
      see a set of people walking after nothing! strolling about without view or
      object! 'tis strange! don't you think so, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I believe so,&rdquo; said Cecilia, scarce hearing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O it gives me the vapours, the horrors,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;to see what poor
      creatures we all are! taking pleasure even from the privation of it!
      forcing ourselves into exercise and toil, when we might at least have the
      indulgence of sitting still and reposing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Sir,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;don't you like walking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walking?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I know nothing so humiliating; to see a rational
      being in such mechanical motion! with no knowledge upon what principles he
      proceeds, but plodding on, one foot before another, without even any
      consciousness which is first, or how either&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; interrupted Mr Hobson, &ldquo;I hope you won't take it amiss if I make
      bold to tell my opinion, for my way is this, let every man speak his
      maxim! But what I say as to this matter, is this, if a man must always be
      stopping to consider what foot he is standing upon, he had need have
      little to do, being the right does as well as the left, and the left as
      well as the right. And that, Sir, I think is a fair argument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows deigned no other answer to this speech than a look of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;you are fond of riding, for all your good
      horsemen like nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riding!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr Meadows, &ldquo;Oh barbarous! Wrestling and boxing are
      polite arts to it! trusting to the discretion of an animal less
      intellectual than ourselves! a sudden spring may break all our limbs, a
      stumble may fracture our sculls! And what is the inducement? to get melted
      with heat, killed with fatigue, and covered with dust! miserable
      infatuation!&mdash;Do you love riding, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very well, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; cried he, with a vacant smile; &ldquo;you are quite
      right; I am entirely of your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Simkins now, with a look of much perplexity, yet rising and bowing,
      said &ldquo;I don't mean, Sir, to be so rude as to put in my oar, but if I did
      not take you wrong, I'm sure just now I thought you seemed for to make no
      great 'count of riding, and yet now, all of the sudden, one would think
      you was a speaking up for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;if you neither like riding nor walking, you
      can have no pleasure at all but only in sitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting!&rdquo; repeated Mr Meadows, with a yawn, &ldquo;O worse and worse! it
      dispirits me to death! it robs me of all fire and life! it weakens
      circulation, and destroys elasticity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray then, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;do you like any better to stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stand? O intolerable! the most unmeaning thing in the world! one had
      better be made a mummy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, pray Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, &ldquo;let me ask the favour of you to
      tell us what it is you <i>do</i> like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, though he stared him full in the face, began picking his teeth
      without making any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mr Hobson,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, &ldquo;the gentleman has no mind for to
      tell you; but if I may take the liberty just to put in, I think if he
      neither likes walking, nor riding, nor sitting, nor standing, I take it he
      likes nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;but here comes supper, and I hope you will
      like that. Pray Sir, may I help you to a bit of this ham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, not seeming to hear him, suddenly, and with an air of extreme
      weariness, arose, and without speaking to anybody, abruptly made his way
      out of the box. &mdash; Mr Harrel now, starting from the gloomy reverie
      into which he had sunk, undertook to do the honours of the table,
      insisting with much violence upon helping every body, calling for more
      provisions, and struggling to appear in high spirits and good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Captain Aresby, who was passing by the box, stopt to make
      his compliments to Mrs Harrel and Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a concourse!&rdquo; he cried, casting up his eyes with an expression of
      half-dying fatigue, &ldquo;are you not <i>accablé</i>? for my part, I hardly
      respire. I have really hardly ever had the honour of being so <i>obsedé</i>
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can make very good room, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;if you chuse to come
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, obsequiously standing up, &ldquo;I am sure the gentleman
      will be very welcome to take my place, for I did not mean for to sit down,
      only just to look agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, Sir,&rdquo; answered the Captain; &ldquo;I shall be quite <i>au
      desespoir</i> if I derange any body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, &ldquo;I don't offer you my place, because I take it for
      granted if you had a mind to come in, you would not stand upon ceremony;
      for what I say is, let every man speak his mind, and then we shall all
      know how to conduct ourselves. That's my way, and let any man tell me a
      better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, after looking at him with a surprise not wholly unmixt with
      horror, turned from him without making any answer, and said to Cecilia,
      &ldquo;And how long, ma'am, have you tried this petrifying place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour,&mdash;two hours, I believe,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? and nobody here! <i>assez de monde</i>, but nobody here! a blank
      <i>partout</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, getting out of the box that he might bow with more
      facility, &ldquo;I humbly crave pardon for the liberty, but if I understood
      right, you said something of a blank? pray, Sir, if I may be so free, has
      there been any thing of the nature of a lottery, or a raffle, in the
      garden? or the like of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the Captain, regarding him from head to foot, &ldquo;I am quite <i>assommé</i>
      that I cannot comprehend your allusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I ask pardon,&rdquo; said the man, bowing still lower, &ldquo;I only thought if
      in case it should not be above half a crown, or such a matter as that, I
      might perhaps stretch a point once in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, more and more amazed, stared at him again, but not thinking
      it necessary to take any further notice of him, he enquired of Cecilia if
      she meant to stay late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I have already stayed later than I wished to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said he, with an unmeaning smile, &ldquo;Well, that is as horrid a
      thing as I have the <i>malheur</i> to know. For my part, I make it a
      principle not to stay long in these semi-barbarous places, for after a
      certain time, they bore me to that degree I am quite <i>abimé</i>. I
      shall, however, do <i>mon possible</i> to have the honour of seeing you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a smile of yet greater insipidity, he protested he was <i>reduced
      to despair</i> in leaving her, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, ma'am, if I may be so bold,&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, &ldquo;what countryman may
      that gentleman be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Englishman, I suppose, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Englishman, ma'am!&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, &ldquo;why I could not understand one
      word in ten that came out of his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, &ldquo;he has a mighty peticklar way of speaking,
      for I'm sure I thought I could have sworn he said something of a blank, or
      to that amount, but I could make nothing of it when I come to ask him
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let every man speak to be understood,&rdquo; cried Mr Hobson, &ldquo;that's my notion
      of things; for as to all those fine words that nobody can make out, I hold
      them to be of no use. Suppose a man was to talk in that manner when he's
      doing business, what would be the upshot? who'd understand what he meant?
      Well, that's the proof; what i'n't fit for business, i'n't of no value;
      that's my way of judging, and that's what I go upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said some other things,&rdquo; rejoined Mr Simkins, &ldquo;that I could not make
      out very clear, only I had no mind to ask any more questions, for fear of
      his answering me something I should not understand; but as well as I could
      make it out, I thought I heard him say there was nobody here! what he
      could mean by that, I can't pretend for to guess, for I'm sure the garden
      is so stock full, that if there was to come many more, I don't know where
      they could cram 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took notice of it at the time,&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, &ldquo;for it i'n't many
      things are lost upon me; and, to tell you the truth, I thought he had been
      making pretty free with his bottle, by his seeing no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bottle!&rdquo; cried Mr Harrel, &ldquo;a most excellent hint, Mr Hobson! come! let us
      all make free with the bottle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then called for more wine, and insisted that every body should pledge
      him. Mr Marriot and Mr Morrice made not any objection, and Mr Hobson and
      Mr Simkins consented with much delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel now grew extremely unruly, the wine he had already drunk being
      thus powerfully aided; and his next project was to make his wife and
      Cecilia follow his example. Cecilia, more incensed than ever to see no
      preparation made for his departure, and all possible pains taken to unfit
      him for setting out, refused him with equal firmness and displeasure, and
      lamented, with the bitterest self-reproaches, the consent which had been
      forced from her to be present at a scene of such disorder; but Mrs Harrel
      would have opposed him in vain, had not his attention been called off to
      another object. This was Sir Robert Floyer, who perceiving the party at
      some distance, no sooner observed Mr Marriot in such company, than
      advancing to the box with an air of rage and defiance, he told Mr Harrel
      he had something to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried Harrel, &ldquo;say to me? and so have I to say to you! Come amongst
      us and be merry! Here, make room, make way! Sit close, my friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert, who now saw he was in no situation to be reasoned with, stood
      for a moment silent; and then, looking round the box, and observing Messrs
      Hobson and Simkins, he exclaimed aloud &ldquo;Why what queer party have you got
      into? who the d&mdash;-l have you picked up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Hobson, who, to the importance of lately acquired wealth, now added the
      courage of newly drunk Champagne, stoutly kept his ground, without seeming
      at all conscious he was included in this interrogation; but Mr Simkins,
      who had still his way to make in the world, and whose habitual servility
      would have resisted a larger draught, was easily intimidated; he again,
      therefore stood up, and with the most cringing respect offered the Baronet
      his place; who, taking neither of the offer nor offerer the smallest
      notice, still stood opposite to Mr Harrel, waiting for some explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel, however, who now grew really incapable of giving any, only
      repeated his invitation that he would make one among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One among you?&rdquo; cried he, angrily, and pointing to Mr Hobson, &ldquo;why you
      don't fancy I'll sit down with a bricklayer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bricklayer?&rdquo; said Mr Harrel, &ldquo;ay, sure, and a hosier too; sit down, Mr
      Simkins, keep your place, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Simkins most thankfully bowed; but Mr Hobson, who could no longer avoid
      feeling the personality of this reflection, boldly answered, &ldquo;Sir, you may
      sit down with a worse man any day in the week! I have done nothing I'm
      ashamed of, and no man can say to me why did you so? I don't tell you,
      Sir, what I'm worth; no one has a right to ask; I only say three times
      five is fifteen! that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why what the d&mdash;&mdash;l, you impudent fellow,&rdquo; cried the haughty
      Baronet, &ldquo;you don't presume to mutter, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Mr Hobson, very hotly, &ldquo;I sha'n't put up with abuse from
      no man! I've got a fair character in the world, and wherewithal to live by
      my own liking. And what I have is my own, and all I say is, let every one
      say the same, for that's the way to fear no man, and face the d&mdash;&mdash;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that, fellow?&rdquo; cried Sir Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow, Sir! this is talking no how. Do you think a man of substance,
      that's got above the world, is to be treated like a little scrubby
      apprentice? Let every man have his own, that's always my way of thinking;
      and this I can say for myself, I have as good a right to shew my head
      where I please as ever a member of parliament in all England; and I wish
      every body here could say as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert, fury starting into his eyes, was beginning an answer; but Mrs
      Harrel with terror, and Cecilia with dignity, calling upon them both to
      forbear, the Baronet desired Morrice to relinquish his place to him, and
      seating himself next to Mrs Harrel, gave over the contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr Simkins, hoping to ingratiate himself with the company,
      advanced to Mr Hobson, already cooled by finding himself unanswered, and
      reproachfully said &ldquo;Mr Hobson, if I may make so free, I must needs be bold
      to say I am quite ashamed of you! a person of your standing and credit for
      to talk so disrespectful! as if a gentleman had not a right to take a
      little pleasure, because he just happens to owe you a little matters of
      money; fie, fie, Mr Hobson! I did not expect you to behave so
      despiseable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despiseable!&rdquo; answered Mr Hobson, &ldquo;I'd scorn as much to do anything
      despiseable as yourself, or any thing misbecoming of a gentleman; and as
      to coming to such a place as this may be, why I have no objection to it.
      All I stand to is this, let every man have his due; for as to taking a
      little pleasure, here I am, as one may say, doing the same myself; but
      where's the harm of that? who's a right to call a man to account that's
      clear of the world? Not that I mean to boast, nor nothing like it, but, as
      I said before; five times five is fifteen; [Footnote; I hardly know
      whether the authoress has here forgotten her arithmetic, or intentionally
      suffered Mr Hobson to forget his, from the effects of champagne.&mdash;Ed.]&mdash;that's
      my calculation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel, who, during this debate, had still continued drinking,
      regardless of all opposition from his wife and Cecilia, now grew more and
      more turbulent; he insisted that Mr Simkins should return to his seat,
      ordered him another bumper of champagne, and saying he had not half
      company enough to raise his spirits, desired Morrice to go and invite
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrice, always ready to promote a frolic, most chearfully consented; but
      when Cecilia, in a low voice, supplicated him to bring no one back, with
      still more readiness he made signs that he understood and would obey her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel then began to sing, and in so noisy and riotous a manner, that
      nobody approached the box without stopping to stare at him; and those who
      were new to such scenes, not contented with merely looking in, stationed
      themselves at some distance before it, to observe what was passing, and to
      contemplate with envy and admiration an appearance of mirth and enjoyment
      which they attributed to happiness and pleasure! Mrs Harrel, shocked to be
      seen in such mixed company, grew every instant more restless and
      miserable; and Cecilia, half distracted to think how they were to get
      home, had passed all her time in making secret vows that if once again she
      was delivered from Mr Harrel she would never see him more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Floyer perceiving their mutual uneasiness, proposed to escort
      them home himself; and Cecilia, notwithstanding her aversion to him, was
      listening to the scheme, when Mr Marriot, who had been evidently provoked
      and disconcerted since the junction of the Baronet, suspecting what was
      passing, offered his services also, and in a tone of voice that did not
      promise a very quiet acquiescence in a refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who, too easily, in their looks, saw all the eagerness of
      rivalry, now dreaded the consequence of her decision, and therefore
      declined the assistance of either; but her distress was unspeakable, as
      there was not one person in the party to whose care she could commit
      herself, though the behaviour of Mr Harrel, which every moment grew more
      disorderly, rendered the necessity of quitting him urgent and
      uncontroulable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Morrice returned, stopping in the midst of his loud and violent
      singing, he vehemently demanded what company he had brought him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all, sir,&rdquo; answered Morrice, looking significantly at Cecilia; &ldquo;I
      have really been so unlucky as not to meet with any body who had a mind to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; answered he, starting up, &ldquo;I will seek some for myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;O
      no, pray, Mr Harrel, bring nobody else,&rdquo; cried his wife. &ldquo;Hear us in
      pity,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;and distress us no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distress you?&rdquo; cried he, with quickness, &ldquo;what shall I not bring you
      those pretty girls? Yes, one more glass, and I will teach you to welcome
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he poured out another bumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is so insupportable!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, rising, &ldquo;[that] I can remain
      here no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is cruel indeed,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Harrel, bursting into tears; &ldquo;did you
      only bring me here to insult me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried he, suddenly embracing her, &ldquo;by this parting kiss!&rdquo; then
      wildly jumping upon his seat, he leapt over the table, and was out of
      sight in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazement seized all who remained; Mrs Harrel and Cecilia, indeed, doubted
      not but he was actually gone to the chaise he had ordered; but the manner
      of his departure affrighted them, and his preceding behaviour had made
      them cease to expect it; Mrs Harrel, leaning upon Cecilia, continued to
      weep, while she, confounded and alarmed, scarce knew whether she should
      stay and console her, or fly after Mr Harrel, whom she feared had
      incapacitated himself from finding his chaise, by the very method he had
      taken to gather courage for seeking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was but the apprehension of a moment; another and a far
      more horrible one drove it from her imagination; for scarcely had Mr
      Harrel quitted the box and their sight, before their ears were suddenly
      struck with the report of a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel gave a loud scream, which was involuntarily echoed by, Cecilia;
      everybody arose, some with officious zeal to serve the ladies, and others
      to hasten to the spot whence the dreadful sound proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Floyer again offered his services in conducting them home; but
      they could listen to no such proposal; Cecilia, with difficulty refrained
      from rushing out herself to discover what was passing; but her dread of
      being followed by Mrs Harrel prevented her; they both, therefore, waited,
      expecting every instant some intelligence, as all but the Baronet and Mr
      Marriot were now gone to seek it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody, however, returned; and their terrors encreased every moment; Mrs
      Harrel wanted to run out herself, but Cecilia, conjuring her to keep
      still, begged Mr Marriot to bring them some account. Mr Marriot, like the
      messengers who had preceded him, came not back; an instant seemed an age,
      and Sir Robert Floyer was also entreated to procure information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel and Cecilia were now left to themselves, and their horror was
      too great for speech or motion; they stood close to each other, listening
      to every sound and receiving every possible addition to their alarm, by
      the general confusion which they observed in the gardens, in which, though
      both gentlemen and waiters were running to and fro, not a creature was
      walking, and all amusement seemed forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this dreadful state they were at length removed, though not relieved,
      by the sight of a waiter, who, as he was passing shewed himself almost
      covered with blood! Mrs Harrel vehemently called after him, demanding
      whence it came? &ldquo;From the gentleman, ma'am,&rdquo; answered he in haste, &ldquo;that
      has shot himself,&rdquo; and then ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel uttered a piercing scream, and sunk on the ground; for Cecilia,
      shuddering with horror, lost all her own strength, and could no longer
      lend her any support.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great at this time was the general confusion of the place, that for
      some minutes their particular distress was unknown, and their situation
      unnoticed; till at length an elderly gentleman came up to the box, and
      humanely offered his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, pointing to her unfortunate friend, who had not fallen into a
      fainting fit, but merely from weakness and terror, accepted his help in
      raising her. She was lifted up, however, without the smallest effort on
      her own part, and was only kept upon her seat by being held there by the
      stranger, for Cecilia, whose whole frame was shaking, tried in vain to
      sustain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman, from the violence of their distress, began now to suspect
      its motive, and addressing himself to Cecilia, said, &ldquo;I am afraid, madam,
      this unfortunate gentleman was some Relation to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them spoke, but their silence was sufficiently expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pity, madam,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that some friend can't order him out
      of the crowd, and have him kept quiet till a surgeon can be brought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surgeon!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, recovering from one surprize by the effect
      of another; &ldquo;is it then possible he may be saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without waiting to have her question answered, she ran out of the box
      herself, flying wildly about the garden, and calling for help as she flew,
      till she found the house by the entrance; and then, going up to the bar,
      &ldquo;Is a surgeon sent for?&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;let a surgeon be fetched
      instantly!&rdquo; &ldquo;A surgeon, ma'am,&rdquo; she was answered, &ldquo;is not the gentleman
      dead?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he must be brought in; let some careful
      people go and bring him in.&rdquo; Nor would she quit the bar, till two or three
      waiters were called, and received her orders. And then, eager to see them
      executed herself, she ran, fearless of being alone, and without thought of
      being lost, towards the fatal spot whither the crowd guided her. She could
      not, indeed, have been more secure from insult or molestation if
      surrounded by twenty guards; for the scene of desperation and horror which
      many had witnessed, and of which all had heard the signal, engrossed the
      universal attention, and took, even from the most idle and licentious, all
      spirit for gallantry and amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, while making vain attempts to penetrate through the multitude, that
      she might see and herself judge the actual situation of Mr Harrel, and
      give, if yet there was room for hope, such orders as would best conduce to
      his safety and recovery, she was met by Mr Marriot, who entreated her not
      to press forward to a sight which he had found too shocking for himself,
      and insisted upon protecting her through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is alive,&rdquo; cried she, refusing his aid, &ldquo;and if there is any chance
      he may be saved, no sight shall be too shocking to deter me from seeing
      him properly attended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All attendance,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;will be in vain; he is not indeed, yet
      dead, but his recovery is impossible. There is a surgeon with him already;
      one who happened to be in the gardens, and he told me himself that the
      wound was inevitably mortal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though greatly disappointed, still determined to make way to him,
      that she might herself enquire if, in his last moments, there was any
      thing he wished to communicate, or desired to have done; but, as she
      struggled to proceed, she was next met and stopt by Sir Robert Floyer,
      who, forcing her back, acquainted her that all was over!
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock with which she received this account, though unmixed with any
      tenderness of regret, and resulting merely from general humanity, was yet
      so violent as almost to overpower her. Mr Harrel, indeed, had forfeited
      all right to her esteem, and the unfeeling selfishness of his whole
      behaviour had long provoked her resentment and excited her disgust; yet a
      catastrophe so dreadful, and from which she had herself made such efforts
      to rescue him, filled her with so much horror, that, turning extremely
      sick, she was obliged to be supported to the nearest box, and stop there
      for hartshorn and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes, however, sufficed to divest her of all care for herself, in
      the concern with which she recollected the situation of Mrs Harrel; she
      hastened, therefore, back to her, attended by the Baronet and Mr Marriot,
      and found her still leaning upon the stranger, and weeping aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal news had already reached her; and though all affection between
      Mr Harrel and herself had mutually subsided from the first two or three
      months of their marriage, a conclusion so horrible to all connection
      between them could not be heard without sorrow and distress. Her temper,
      too, naturally soft, retained not resentment, and Mr Harrel, now separated
      from her for ever, was only remembered as the Mr Harrel who first won her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither pains nor tenderness were spared on the part of Cecilia to console
      her; who finding her utterly incapable either of acting or directing for
      herself, and knowing her at all times to be extremely helpless, now
      summoned to her own aid all the strength of mind she possessed, and
      determined upon this melancholy occasion, both to think and act for her
      widowed friend to the utmost stretch of her abilities and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, therefore, as the first effusions of her grief were over, she
      prevailed with her to go to the house, where she was humanely offered the
      use of a quiet room till she should be better able to set off for town.
      Cecilia, having seen her thus safely lodged, begged Mr Marriot to stay
      with her, and then, accompanied by the Baronet, returned herself to the
      bar, and desiring the footman who had attended them to be called, sent him
      instantly to his late master, and proceeded next with great presence of
      mind, to inquire further into the particulars of what had passed, and to
      consult upon what was immediately to be done with the deceased; for she
      thought it neither decent nor right to leave to chance or to strangers the
      last duties which could be paid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lingered, she found, about a quarter of an hour, but in a condition
      too dreadful for description, quite speechless, and, by all that could be
      judged, out of his senses; yet so distorted with pain, and wounded so
      desperately beyond any power of relief, that the surgeon, who every
      instant expected his death, said it would not be merely useless but
      inhuman, to remove him till he had breathed his last. He died, therefore,
      in the arms of this gentleman and a waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A waiter!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, reproachfully looking at Sir Robert, &ldquo;and was
      there no friend who for the few poor moments that remained had patience to
      support him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would be the good,&rdquo; said Sir Robert, &ldquo;of supporting a man in his
      last agonies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This unfeeling speech she attempted not to answer, but, suffering neither
      her dislike to him, nor her scruples for herself, to interfere with the
      present occasion, she desired to have his advice what was now best to be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undertaker's men must immediately, he said, be sent for, to remove the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then gave orders for that purpose, which were instantly executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither the body was to go was the next question; Cecilia wished the
      removal to be directly to the townhouse, but Sir Robert told her it must
      be carried to the nearest undertaker's, and kept there till it could be
      conveyed to town in a coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this, also, in the name of Mrs Harrel, she gave directions. And then
      addressing herself to Sir Robert, &ldquo;You will now Sir, I hope,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;return to the fatal spot, and watch by your late unfortunate friend till
      the proper people arrive to take charge of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what good will that do?&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;had I not better watch by you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do good,&rdquo; answered she, with some severity, &ldquo;to decency and to
      humanity; and surely you cannot refuse to see who is with him, and in what
      situation he lies, and whether he has met, from the strangers with whom he
      was left, the tenderness and care which his friends ought to have paid
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise, then,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;not to go away till I come back?
      for I have no great ambition to sacrifice the living for the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will promise nothing, Sir,&rdquo; said she, shocked at his callous
      insensibility; &ldquo;but if you refuse this last poor office, I must apply
      elsewhere; and firmly I believe there is no other I can ask who will a
      moment hesitate in complying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then went back to Mrs Harrel, leaving, however, an impression upon the
      mind of Sir Robert, that made him no longer dare dispute her commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her next solicitude was how they should return to town; they had no
      equipage of their own, and the only servant who came with them was
      employed in performing the last duties for his deceased master. Her first
      intention was to order a hackney coach, but the deplorable state of Mrs
      Harrel made it almost impossible she could take the sole care of her, and
      the lateness of the night, and their distance from home, gave her a dread
      invincible to going so far without some guard or assistant. Mr Marriot
      earnestly desired to have the honour of conveying them to Portman-square
      in his own carriage, and notwithstanding there were many objections to
      such a proposal, the humanity of his behaviour upon the present occasion,
      and the evident veneration which accompanied his passion, joined to her
      encreasing aversion to the Baronet, from whom she could not endure to
      receive the smallest obligation, determined her, after much perplexity and
      hesitation, to accept his offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She begged him, therefore, to immediately order his coach, and, happy to
      obey her, he went out with that design; but, instantly coming back, told
      her, in a low voice, that they must wait some time longer, as the
      Undertaker's people were then entering the garden, and if they stayed not
      till the removal had taken place, Mrs Harrel might be shocked with the
      sight of some of the men, or perhaps even meet the dead body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, thanking him for this considerate precaution, readily agreed to
      defer setting out; devoting, mean time, all her attention to Mrs Harrel,
      whose sorrow, though violent, forbad not consolation. But before the
      garden was cleared, and the carriage ordered, Sir Robert returned; saying
      to Cecilia, with an air of parading obedience which seemed to claim some
      applause, &ldquo;Miss Beverley, your commands have been executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia made not any answer, and he presently added, &ldquo;Whenever you chuse
      to go I will order up my coach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> coach, Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Marriot, &ldquo;will be ordered when the ladies
      are ready, and I hope to have the honour myself of conducting them to
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; cried the Baronet, &ldquo;that can never be; my long acquaintance
      with Mrs Harrel gives me a prior right to attend her, and I can by no
      means suffer any other person to rob me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing,&rdquo; said Mr Marriot, &ldquo;to say to that, Sir, but Miss Beverley
      herself has done me the honour to consent to make use of my carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley, I think,&rdquo; said Sir Robert, extremely piqued, &ldquo;can never
      have sent me out of the way in order to execute her own commands, merely
      to deprive me of the pleasure of attending her and Mrs Harrel home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, somewhat alarmed, now sought to lessen the favour of her
      decision, though she adhered to it without wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intention,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;was not to confer, but to receive an
      obligation; and I had hoped, while Mr. Marriot assisted us, Sir Robert
      would be far more humanely employed in taking charge of what we cannot
      superintend, and yet are infinitely more anxious should not be neglected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Sir Robert, &ldquo;is all done; and I hope, therefore, after
      sending me upon such an errand, you don't mean to refuse me the pleasure
      of seeing you to town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Robert,&rdquo; said Cecilia, greatly displeased, &ldquo;I cannot argue with you
      now; I have already settled my plan, and I am not at leisure to
      re-consider it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert bit his lips for a moment in angry silence; but not enduring to
      lose the victory to a young rival he despised, he presently said, &ldquo;If I
      must talk no more about it to you, madam, I must at least beg leave to
      talk of it to this gentleman, and take the liberty to represent to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now, dreading how his speech might be answered, prevented its
      being finished, and with an air of the most spirited dignity, said, &ldquo;Is it
      possible, sir, that at a time such as this, you should not be wholly
      indifferent to a matter so frivolous? little indeed will be the pleasure
      which our society can afford! your dispute however, has given it some
      importance, and therefore Mr Marriot must accept my thanks for his
      civility, and excuse me for retracting my consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Supplications and remonstrances were, however, still poured upon her from
      both, and the danger, the impossibility that two ladies could go to town
      alone, in a hackney coach, and without even a servant, at near four
      o'clock in the morning, they mutually urged, vehemently entreating that
      she would run no such hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was far other than insensible to these representations; the
      danger, indeed, appeared to her so formidable, that her inclination the
      whole time opposed her refusal; yet her repugnance to giving way to the
      overbearing Baronet, and her fear of his resentment if she listened to Mr
      Marriot, forced her to be steady, since she saw that her preference would
      prove the signal of a quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inattentive, therefore, to their joint persecution, she again deliberated
      by what possible method she could get home in safety; but unable to devise
      any, she at last resolved to make enquiries of the people in the bar, who
      had been extremely humane and civil, whether they could assist or counsel
      her. She therefore desired the two gentlemen to take care of Mrs Harrel,
      to which neither dared dissent, as both could not refuse, and hastily
      arising, went out of the room; but great indeed was her surprize when, as
      she was walking up to the bar, she was addressed by young Delvile!
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching her with that air of gravity and distance which of late he had
      assumed in her presence, he was beginning some speech about his mother;
      but the instant the sound of his voice reached Cecilia, she joyfully
      clasped her hands, and eagerly exclaimed, &ldquo;Mr Delvile!&mdash;O now we are
      safe!&mdash;this is fortunate indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe, Madam,&rdquo; cried he astonished, &ldquo;yes I hope so!&mdash;has any thing
      endangered your safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no matter for danger,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;we will now trust ourselves with
      you, and I am sure you will protect us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Protect you!&rdquo; repeated he again, and with warmth, &ldquo;yes, while I live!&mdash;but
      what is the matter?&mdash;why are you so pale?&mdash;are you ill?&mdash;are
      you frightened?&mdash;what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And losing all coldness and reserve, with the utmost earnestness he begged
      her to explain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;what has happened? Can you be here and not
      have heard it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I am but this moment arrived; my mother grew
      uneasy that she did not see you, she sent to your house, and was told that
      you were not returned from Vauxhall; some other circumstances also alarmed
      her, and therefore, late as it was, I came hither myself. The instant I
      entered this place, I saw you here. This is all my history; tell me now
      yours. Where is your party? where are Mr and Mrs Harrel?&mdash;Why are you
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ask not!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I cannot tell you!&mdash;take us but under your
      care, and you will soon know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then hurried from him, and returning to Mrs Harrel, said she had now a
      conveyance at once safe and proper, and begged her to rise and come away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen, however, rose first, each of them declaring he would
      himself attend them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cecilia, steadily, &ldquo;that trouble will now be superfluous; Mrs
      Delvile herself has sent for me, and her son is now waiting till we join
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazement and disappointment at this intelligence were visible in the
      faces of them both; Cecilia waited not a single question, but finding she
      was unable to support Mrs Harrel, who rather suffered herself to be
      carried than led, she entrusted her between them, and ran forward to
      enquire of Delvile if his carriage was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him with a look of horror that told the tale he had been
      hearing, listening to one of the waiters; the moment she appeared, he flew
      to her, and with the utmost emotion exclaimed, &ldquo;Amiable Miss Beverley!
      what a dreadful scene have you witnessed! what a cruel task have you nobly
      performed! such spirit with such softness! so much presence of mind with
      such feeling!&mdash;but you are all excellence! human nature can rise no
      higher! I believe indeed you are its most perfect ornament!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Praise such as this, so unexpected, and delivered with such energy,
      Cecilia heard not without pleasure, even at a moment when her whole mind
      was occupied by matters foreign to its peculiar interests. She made,
      however, her enquiry about the carriage, and he told her that he had come
      in a hackney coach, which was waiting for him at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel was now brought in, and little was the recompense her
      assistants received for their aid, when they saw Cecilia so contentedly
      engaged with young Delvile, whose eyes were rivetted on her face, with an
      expression of the most lively admiration; each, however, then quitted the
      other, and hastened to the fair mourner; no time was now lost, Mrs Harrel
      was supported to the coach, Cecilia followed her, and Delvile, jumping in
      after them, ordered the man to drive to Portman-square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert and Mr Marriot, confounded though enraged, saw their departure
      in passive silence; the right of attendance they had so tenaciously denied
      to each other, here admitted not of dispute; Delvile upon this occasion,
      appeared as the representative of his father, and his authority seemed the
      authority of a guardian. Their only consolation was that neither had
      yielded to the other, and all spirit of altercation or revenge was sunk in
      their mutual mortification. At the petition of the waiters, from sullen
      but proud emulation, they paid the expences of the night, and then
      throwing themselves into their carriages, returned to their respective
      houses.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER xiii. &mdash; A SOLUTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the ride to town, not merely Cecilia, but Delvile himself attended
      wholly to Mrs Harrel, whose grief as it became less violent, was more easy
      to be soothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distress of this eventful night was however not yet over; when they
      came to Portman-square, Delvile eagerly called to the coachman not to
      drive up to the house, and anxiously begged Cecilia and Mrs Harrel to sit
      still, while he went out himself to make some enquiries. They were
      surprised at the request, yet immediately consented; but before he had
      quitted them, Davison, who was watching their return, came up to them with
      information that an execution was then in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh misery was now opened for Mrs Harrel, and fresh horror and
      perplexity for Cecilia; she had no longer, however, the whole weight
      either of thought or of conduct upon herself; Delvile in her cares took
      the most animated interest, and beseeching her to wait a moment and
      appease her friend, he went himself into the house to learn the state of
      the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned in a few minutes, and seemed in no haste to communicate what
      he had heard, but entreated them both to go immediately to St
      James's-square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia felt extremely fearful of offending his father by the introduction
      of Mrs Harrel; yet she had nothing better to propose, and therefore, after
      a short and distressed argument, she complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile then told her that the alarm of his mother, at which he had
      already hinted, proceeded from a rumour of this very misfortune, to which,
      though they knew not whether they might give credit, was owing the anxiety
      which at so late an hour, had induced him to go to Vauxhall in search of
      her. They gained admittance without any disturbance, as the servant of
      young Delvile had been ordered to sit up for his master. Cecilia much
      disliked thus taking possession of the house in the night-time, though
      Delvile, solicitous to relieve her, desired she would not waste a thought
      upon the subject, and making his servant shew her the room which had been
      prepared for her reception, he begged her to compose her spirits, and to
      comfort her friend, and promised to acquaint his father and mother when
      they arose with what had happened, that she might be saved all pain from
      surprise or curiosity when they met.
    </p>
    <p>
      This service she thankfully accepted, for she dreaded, after the liberty
      she had taken, to encounter the pride of Mr Delvile without some previous
      apology, and she feared still more to see his lady without the same
      preparation, as her frequent breach of appointment might reasonably have
      offended her, and as her displeasure would affect her more deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now near six o'clock, yet the hours seemed as long as they were
      melancholy till the family arose. They settled to remain quiet till some
      message was sent to them, but before any arrived, Mrs Harrel, who was
      seated upon the bed, wearied by fatigue and sorrow, cried herself to sleep
      like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia rejoiced in seeing this reprieve from affliction, though her
      keener sensations unfitted her from partaking of it; much indeed was the
      uneasiness which kept her awake; the care of Mrs Harrel seemed to devolve
      upon herself, the reception she might meet from the Delviles was
      uncertain, and the horrible adventures of the night, refused for a moment
      to quit her remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock, a message was brought from Mrs Delvile, to know whether
      they were ready for breakfast. Mrs Harrel was still asleep, but Cecilia
      carried her own answer by hastening down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her way she was met by young Delvile, whose air upon first approaching
      her spoke him again prepared to address her with the most distant gravity;
      but almost the moment he looked at her, he forgot his purpose; her
      paleness, the heaviness of her eyes, and the fatigue of long watching
      betrayed by her whole face, again, surprised him into all the tenderness
      of anxiety, and he enquired after her health not as a compliment of
      civility, but as a question in which his whole heart was most deeply
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia thanked him for his attention to her friend the night before, and
      then proceeded to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, coming forward to meet her, removed at once all her fears of
      displeasure, and banished all necessity of apology, by instantly embracing
      her, and warmly exclaiming &ldquo;Charming Miss Beverley! how shall I ever tell
      you half the admiration with which I have heard of your conduct! The
      exertion of so much fortitude at a juncture when a weaker mind would have
      been overpowered by terror, and a heart less under the dominion of
      well-regulated principles, would have sought only its own relief by flying
      from distress and confusion, shews such <i>propriety of mind</i> as can
      only result from the union of good sense with virtue. You are indeed a
      noble creature! I thought so from the moment I beheld you; I shall think
      so, I hope, to the last that I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, penetrated with joy and gratitude, felt in that instant the
      amplest recompense for all that she had suffered, and for all that she had
      lost. Such praise from Mrs Delvile was alone sufficient to make her happy;
      but when she considered whence it sprung, and that the circumstances with
      which she was so much struck, must have been related to her by her son,
      her delight was augmented to an emotion the most pleasing she could
      experience, from seeing how high she was held in the esteem of those who
      were highest in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile then, with the utmost cordiality, began to talk of her
      affairs, saving her the pain of proposing the change of habitation that
      now seemed unavoidable, by an immediate invitation to her house, which she
      made with as much delicacy as if Mr Harrel's had still been open to her,
      and choice, not necessity, had directed her removal. The whole family, she
      told her, went into the country in two days, and she hoped that a new
      scene, with quietness and early hours, would restore both the bloom and
      sprightliness which her late cares and restlessness had injured. And
      though she very seriously lamented the rash action of Mr Harrel, she much
      rejoiced in the acquisition which her own house and happiness would
      receive from her society.
    </p>
    <p>
      She next discussed the situation of her widowed friend, and Cecilia
      produced the packet which had been entrusted to her by her late husband.
      Mrs Delvile advised her to open it in the presence of Mr Arnott, and
      begged her to send for any other of her friends she might wish to see or
      consult, and to claim freely from herself whatever advice or assistance
      she could bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, without waiting for Mr Delvile, she suffered her to swallow a
      hasty breakfast, and return to Mrs Harrel, whom she had desired the
      servants to attend, as she concluded that in her present situation she
      would not chuse to make her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, lightened now from all her cares, more pleased than ever with Mrs
      Delvile, and enchanted that at last she was settled under her roof, went
      back with as much ability as inclination to give comfort to Mrs Harrel.
      She found her but just awaking, and scarce yet conscious where she was, or
      why not in her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her powers of recollection returned, she was soothed with the softest
      compassion by Cecilia, who in pursuance of Mrs Delvile's advice, sent her
      servant in search of Mr Arnott, and in consequence of her permission,
      wrote a note of invitation to Mr Monckton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arnott, who was already in town, soon arrived; his own man, whom he had
      left to watch the motions of Mr Harrel, having early in the morning rode
      to the place of his retreat, with the melancholy tidings of the suicide
      and execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia instantly went down stairs to him. The meeting was extremely
      painful to them both. Mr Arnott severely blamed himself for his flight,
      believing it had hastened the fatal blow, which some further sacrifices
      might perhaps have eluded; and Cecilia half repented the advice she had
      given him, though the failure of her own efforts proved the situation of
      Mr Harrel too desperate for remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then made the tenderest enquiries about his sister, and entreated her
      to communicate to him the minutest particulars of the dreadful
      transaction; after which, she produced the packet, but neither of them had
      the courage to break the seal; and concluding the contents would be no
      less than his last will, they determined some third person should be
      present when they opened it. Cecilia wished much for Mr Monckton, but as
      his being immediately found was uncertain, and the packet might consist of
      orders which ought not to be delayed, she proposed, for the sake of
      expedition, to call in Mr Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arnott readily agreed, and she sent to beg a moment's audience with
      that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was desired to walk into the breakfast-room, where he was sitting with
      his lady and his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not such was now her reception as when she entered that apartment before;
      Mr Delvile looked displeased and out of humour, and, making her a stiff
      bow, while his son brought her a chair, coldly said, &ldquo;If you are hurried,
      Miss Beverley, I will attend you directly; if not, I will finish my
      breakfast, as I shall have but little time the rest of the morning, from
      the concourse of people upon business, who will crowd upon me till dinner,
      most of whom will be extremely distressed if I leave town without
      contriving to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not the least occasion, Sir,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;that I should
      trouble you to quit the room I merely came to beg you would have the
      goodness to be present while Mr Arnott opens a small packet which was last
      night put into my hands by Mr Harrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has Mr Arnott,&rdquo; answered he, somewhat sternly, &ldquo;thought proper to
      send me such a request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;the request is mine; and if, as I now fear, it
      is impertinent, I must entreat you to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as relates merely to yourself,&rdquo; returned Mr Delvile, &ldquo;it is
      another matter; but certainly Mr Arnott can have no possible claim upon my
      time or attention; and I think it rather extraordinary, that a young man
      with whom I have no sort of connection or commerce, and whose very name is
      almost unknown to me, should suppose a person in my style of life so
      little occupied as to be wholly at his command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had no such idea, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, greatly disconcerted; &ldquo;the
      honour of your presence is merely solicited by myself, and simply from the
      apprehension that some directions may be contained in the papers which,
      perhaps, ought immediately to be executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not, I repeat,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, more mildly, &ldquo;displeased at your
      part of this transaction; your want of experience and knowledge of the
      world makes you not at all aware of the consequences which may follow my
      compliance; the papers you speak of may perhaps be of great importance,
      and hereafter the first witness to their being read may be publickly
      called upon. You know not the trouble such an affair may occasion, but Mr
      Arnott ought to be better informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, making another apology for the error which she had committed, was
      in no small confusion, quitting the room; but Mr Delvile, perfectly
      appeased by seeing her distress, stopt her, to say, with much
      graciousness, &ldquo;For your sake, Miss Beverley, I am sorry I cannot act in
      this business; but you see how I am situated! overpowered with affairs of
      my own, and people who can do nothing without my orders. Besides, should
      there hereafter be any investigation into the matter, my name might,
      perhaps, be mentioned, and it would be superfluous to say how ill I should
      think it used by being brought into such company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then left the rooms secretly vowing that no possible exigence
      should in future tempt her to apply for assistance to Mr Delvile, which,
      however ostentatiously offered, was constantly withheld when claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to communicate to Mr Arnott her ill success, when young
      Delvile, with an air of eagerness, followed her into the room. &ldquo;Pardon
      me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;for this intrusion,&mdash;but, tell me, is it impossible
      that in this affair I can represent my father? may not the office you
      meant for him, devolve upon me? remember how near we are to each other,
      and honour me for once with supposing us the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah who, or what, thought Cecilia, can be so different? She thanked him,
      with much sweetness, for his offer, but declined accepting it, saying &ldquo;I
      will not, now I know the inconveniencies of my request, be so selfish as
      even to suffer it should be granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not deny me,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;where is the packet? why should you
      lose a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather ask,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;why I should permit <i>you</i> to lose a
      moment in a matter that does not concern you? and to risk, perhaps, the
      loss of many moments hereafter, from a too incautious politeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can I risk,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;half so precious as your smallest
      satisfaction? do you suppose I can flatter myself with a possibility of
      contributing to it, and yet have the resolution to refuse myself so much
      pleasure? no, no, the heroic times are over, and self-denial is no longer
      in fashion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;but indeed after what has passed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for what has passed,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;we are now to think of
      what is to come. I know you too well to doubt your impatience in the
      execution of a commission which circumstances have rendered sacred; and
      should any thing either be done or omitted contrary to the directions in
      your packet, will you not be apt, blameless as you are, to disturb
      yourself with a thousand fears that you took not proper methods for the
      discharge of your trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this earnestness so like his former behaviour, and
      so far removed from his late reserve, that Cecilia, who perceived it with
      a pleasure she could hardly disguise, now opposed him no longer, but took
      up the packet, and broke the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, to her no small amazement, instead of the expected will, she
      found a roll of enormous bills, and a collection of letters from various
      creditors, threatening the utmost severity of the law if their demands
      were longer unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a slip of paper which held these together, was written, in Mr
      Harrel's hand, <i>To be all paid to-night with a</i> BULLET.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next appeared two letters of another sort; the first of which was from Sir
      Robert Floyer, and in these words;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;As all prospects are now over of the alliance, I hope you will
      excuse my reminding you of the affair at Brookes's of last Christmas. I
      have the honour to be, Sir, yours R. FLOYER.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was from Mr Marriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;Though I should think £2000 nothing for the smallest hope, I
      must take the liberty to say I think it a great deal for only ten minutes;
      you can't have forgot, Sir, the terms of our agreement, but as I find you
      cannot keep to them, I must beg to be off also on my side, and I am
      persuaded you are too much a man of honour to take advantage of my
      over-eagerness in parting with my money without better security. I am,
      Sir, your most humble servant, A. Marriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a scene of fraud, double-dealing, and iniquity was here laid open!
      Cecilia, who at first meant to read every thing aloud, found the attempt
      utterly vain, for so much was she shocked, that she could hardly read on
      to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of all appeared a paper in Mr Harrel's own hand-writing, containing
      these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs Harrel, Miss Beverley, and Mr Arnott.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can struggle no longer, the last blow must now be struck! another day
      robs me of my house and my liberty, and blasts me by the fatal discovery
      of my double attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what I have wished; wholly to be freed, or ruined past all
      resource, and driven to the long-projected remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burthen has my existence been these two years, gay as I have appeared;
      not a night have I gone to bed, but heated and inflamed from a gaming
      table; not a morning have I awaked, but to be soured with a dun!
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not lead such a life again, if the slave who works hardest at the
      oar would change with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I a son, I would bequeath him a plough; I should then leave him
      happier than my parents left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idleness has been my destruction; the want of something to do led me into
      all evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good wife perhaps might have saved me,&mdash;mine, I thank her! tried
      not. Disengaged from me and my affairs, her own pleasures and amusements
      have occupied her solely. Dreadful will be the catastrophe she will see
      to-night; let her bring it home, and live better!
    </p>
    <p>
      If any pity is felt for me, it will be where I have least deserved it! Mr
      Arnott&mdash;Miss Beverley! it will come from you!
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring myself to this final resolution, hard, I confess, have been my
      conflicts; it is not that I have feared death, no, I have long wished it,
      for shame and dread have embittered my days; but something there is within
      me that causes a deeper horror, that asks my preparation for another
      world! that demands my authority for quitting this!&mdash;what may
      hereafter&mdash;O terrible!&mdash;Pray for me, generous Miss Beverley!&mdash;kind,
      gentle Mr Arnott, pray for me!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wretch as Mr Harrel appeared, without religion, principle, or honour, this
      incoherent letter, evidently written in the desperate moment of determined
      suicide, very much affected both Cecilia and Mr Arnott, and in spite
      either of abhorrence or resentment, they mutually shed tears over the
      address to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, to whom every part of the affair was new, could only consider
      these papers as so many specimens of guilt and infamy; he read them,
      therefore, with astonishment and detestation, and openly congratulated
      Cecilia upon having escaped the double snares that were spread for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Mr Monckton arrived; who felt but little
      satisfaction from beholding the lady of his heart in confidential
      discourse with two of his rivals, one of whom had long attacked her by the
      dangerous flattery of perseverance, and the other, without any attack, had
      an influence yet more powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, having performed the office for which he came, concluded, upon
      the entrance of Mr Monckton, that Cecilia had nothing further to wish from
      him; for her long acquaintance with that gentleman, his being a <i>married
      man</i>, and her neighbour in the country, were circumstances well known
      to him; he merely, therefore, enquired if she would honour him with any
      commands, and upon her assuring him she had none, he quietly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no little relief to Mr Monckton, into whose hands Cecilia then
      put the fatal packet; and while he was reading it, at the desire of Mr
      Arnott, she went up stairs to prepare Mrs Harrel for his admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Harrel, unused to solitude, and as eager for company when unhappy to
      console, as when easy to divert her, consented to receive him with
      pleasure; they both wept at the meeting, and Cecilia, after some words of
      general comfort, left them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had then a very long and circumstantial conversation with Mr Monckton,
      who explained whatever had appeared dark in the writings left by Mr
      Harrel, and who came to her before he saw them, with full knowledge of
      what they contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel had contracted with Sir Robert Floyer a large debt of honour
      before the arrival in town of Cecilia; and having no power to discharge
      it, he promised that the prize he expected in his ward should fall to his
      share, upon condition that the debt was cancelled. Nothing was thought
      more easy than to arrange this business, for the Baronet was always to be
      in her way, and the report of the intended alliance was to keep off all
      other pretenders. Several times, however, her coldness made him think the
      matter hopeless; and when he received her letter, he would have given up
      the whole affair; but Mr Harrel, well knowing his inability to satisfy the
      claims that would follow such a defection, constantly persuaded him the
      reserve was affected, and that his own pride and want of assiduity
      occasioned all her discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while thus, by amusing the Baronet with false hopes, he kept off his
      demands, those of others were not less clamorous; his debts increased, his
      power of paying them diminished; he grew sour and desperate, and in one
      night lost £3000 beyond what he could produce, or offer any security for.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, as he said, <i>was what he wished</i>; and now he was, for the
      present, to extricate himself by doubling stakes and winning, or to force
      himself into suicide by doubling such a loss. For though, with tolerable
      ease, he could forget accounts innumerable with his tradesmen, one
      neglected <i>debt of honour</i> rendered his existence insupportable!
    </p>
    <p>
      For this last great effort, his difficulty was to raise the £3000 already
      due, without which the proposal could not be made; and, after various
      artifices and attempts, he at length contrived a meeting with Mr Marriot,
      intreated him to lend him £2000 for only two days, and offered his warmest
      services in his favour with Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rash and impassioned young man, deceived by his accounts into
      believing that his ward was wholly at his disposal, readily advanced the
      money, without any other condition than that of leave to visit freely at
      his house, to the exclusion of Sir Robert Floyer. &ldquo;The other £1000,&rdquo;
       continued Mr Monckton, &ldquo;I know not how he obtained, but he certainly had
      three. You, I hope, were not so unguarded&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr Monckton,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;blame me not too severely! the attacks
      that were made,&mdash;the necessity of otherwise betraying the worthy and
      half ruined Mr. Arnott&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh fie,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;to suffer your understanding to be lulled asleep,
      because the weak-minded Mr Arnott's could not be kept awake! I thought,
      after such cautions from me, and such experience of your own, you could
      not again have been thus duped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so too,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;but yet when the trial came on,&mdash;indeed
      you know not how I was persecuted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you see,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;the utter inutility of the attempt; you see,
      and I told you beforehand, that nothing could save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but had I been firmer in refusal, I might not so well have known
      it; I might then have upbraided myself with supposing that my compliance
      would have rescued him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have indeed,&rdquo; cried Mr Monckton, &ldquo;fallen into most worthless hands,
      and the Dean was much to blame for naming so lightly a guardian to a
      fortune such as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;he never entrusted him with my fortune, he
      committed it wholly to Mr Briggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he knew not the various subterfuges by which such a caution might
      be baffled, he ought to have taken advice of those who were better
      informed. Mr Briggs, too! what a wretch! mean, low, vulgar, sordid!&mdash;the
      whole city of London, I believe, could not produce such another! how
      unaccountable to make you the ward of a man whose house you cannot enter
      without disgust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His house,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;my uncle never wished me to enter; he
      believed, and he was right, that my fortune would be safe in his hands;
      but for myself, he concluded I should always reside at Mr Harrel's.&rdquo; &ldquo;But
      does not the city at this time,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, &ldquo;abound in families
      where, while your fortune was in security, you might yourself have lived
      with propriety? Nothing requires circumspection so minute as the choice of
      a guardian to a girl of large fortune, and in general one thing only is
      attended to, an appearance of property. Morals, integrity, character, are
      either not thought of, or investigated so superficially, that the enquiry
      were as well wholly omitted.&rdquo; He then continued his relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Harrel hastened with his £3000 to the gaming table; one throw of the
      dice settled the business, he lost, and ought immediately to have doubled
      the sum. That, however, was never more likely to be in his power; he knew
      it; he knew, too, the joint claims of Cecilia's deceived admirers, and
      that his house was again threatened with executions from various quarters;&mdash;he
      went home, loaded his pistols, and took the methods already related to
      work himself into courage for the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The means by which Mr Monckton had procured these particulars were many
      and various, and not all such as he could avow; since in the course of his
      researches, he had tampered with servants and waiters, and scrupled at no
      methods that led but to discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did his intelligence stop here; he had often, he said, wondered at the
      patience of Mr Harrel's creditors, but now even that was cleared up by a
      fresh proof of infamy; he had been himself at the house in Portmansquare,
      where he was informed that Mr Harrel had kept them quiet, by repeated
      assurances that his ward, in a short time, meant to lend him money for
      discharging them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia saw now but too clearly the reason her stay in his house was so
      important to him; and wondered less at his vehemence upon that subject,
      though she detested it more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh how little,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;are the gay and the dissipated to be known
      upon a short acquaintance! expensive, indeed, and thoughtless and
      luxurious he appeared to me immediately; but fraudulent, base, designing,
      capable of every pernicious art of treachery and duplicity,&mdash;such,
      indeed, I expected not to find him, his very flightiness and levity seemed
      incompatible with such hypocrisy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His flightiness,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, &ldquo;proceeded not from gaiety of heart,
      it was merely the effect of effort; and his spirits were as mechanical as
      his taste for diversion. He had not strong parts, nor were his vices the
      result of his passions; had oeconomy been as much in fashion as
      extravagance, he would have been equally eager to practice it; he was a
      mere time-server, he struggled but to be <i>something</i>, and having
      neither talents nor sentiment to know <i>what</i>, he looked around him
      for any pursuit, and seeing distinction was more easily attained in the
      road to ruin than in any other, he gallopped along it, thoughtless of
      being thrown when he came to the bottom, and sufficiently gratified in
      shewing his horsemanship by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, all that he had either to hear or to communicate upon this
      subject being told, he enquired, with a face strongly expressive of his
      disapprobation, why he found her at Mr Delvile's, and what had become of
      her resolution to avoid his house?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who, in the hurry of her mind and her affairs, had wholly
      forgotten that such a resolution had been taken, blushed at the question,
      and could not, at first, recollect what had urged her to break it; but
      when he proceeded to mention Mr Briggs, she was no longer distressed; she
      gave a circumstantial account of her visit to him, related the mean misery
      in which he lived, and told him the impracticability of her residing in
      such a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton could now in decency make no further opposition, however
      painful and reluctant was his acquiescence; yet before he quitted her, he
      gave himself the consolation of considerably obliging her, and softened
      his chagrin by the sweetness of her acknowledgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enquired how much money in all she had now taken up of the Jew; and
      hearing it was £9050, he represented to her the additional loss she must
      suffer by paying an exorbitant interest for so large a sum, and the almost
      certainty with which she might be assured of very gross imposition; he
      expatiated, also, upon the injury which her character might receive in the
      world, were it known that she used such methods to procure money, since
      the circumstances which had been her inducement would probably either be
      unnoticed or misrepresented; and when he had awakened in her much
      uneasiness and regret upon this subject, he offered to pay the Jew without
      delay, clear her wholly from his power, and quietly receive the money when
      she came of age from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proposal so truly friendly made her look upon the regard of Mr Monckton
      in a higher and nobler point of view than her utmost esteem and reverence
      had hitherto placed it; yet she declined at first accepting the offer,
      from an apprehension it might occasion him inconvenience; but when he
      assured her he had a yet larger sum lying at present useless in a Banker's
      hands, and promised to receive the same interest for his money he should
      be paid from the funds, she joyfully listened to him; and it was settled
      that they should send for the Jew, take his discharge, and utterly dismiss
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton, however, fearful of appearing too officious in her affairs,
      wished not to have his part in the transaction published, and advised
      Cecilia not to reveal the matter to the Delviles. But great as was his
      [ascendancy] over her mind, her aversion to mystery and hypocrisy were
      still greater; she would not, therefore, give him this promise, though her
      own desire to wait some seasonable opportunity for disclosing it, made her
      consent that their meeting with the Jew should be at the house of Mrs
      Roberts in Fetter-lane, at twelve o'clock the next morning; where she
      might also see Mrs Hill and her children before she left town.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now parted, Cecilia charmed more than ever with her friend, whose
      kindness, as she suspected not his motives, seemed to spring from the most
      disinterested generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, however, was the smallest feature in the character of Mr Monckton,
      who was entirely a man of the world, shrewd, penetrating, attentive to his
      interest, and watchful of every advantage to improve it. In the service he
      now did Cecilia, he was gratified by giving her pleasure, but that was by
      no means his only gratification; he still hoped her fortune would one day
      be his own, he was glad to transact any business with her, and happy in
      making her owe to him an obligation; but his principal inducement was yet
      stronger; he saw with much alarm the facility of her liberality; and he
      feared while she continued in correspondence with the Jew, that the
      easiness with which she could raise money would be a motive with her to
      continue the practice whenever she was softened by distress, or subdued by
      entreaty; but he hoped, by totally concluding the negociation, the
      temptation would be removed; and that the hazard and inconvenience of
      renewing it, would strengthen her aversion to such an expedient, till,
      between difficulties and disuse, that dangerous resource would be thought
      of no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then returned to Mrs Harrel, whom she found as she had left,
      weeping in the arms of her brother. They consulted upon what was best to
      be done, and agreed that she ought instantly to leave town; for which
      purpose a chaise was ordered directly. They settled also that Mr Arnott,
      when he had conveyed her to his country house, which was in Suffolk,
      should hasten back to superintend the funeral, and see if anything could
      be saved from the creditors for his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this plan, till Cecilia was summoned to dinner, they had not the
      resolution to put in practice. They were then obliged to be gone, and
      their parting was very melancholy. Mrs Harrel wept immoderately, and Mr
      Arnott felt a concern too tender for avowal, though too sincere for
      concealment. Cecilia, however glad to change her situation, was extremely
      depressed by their sorrow, and entreated to have frequent accounts of
      their proceedings, warmly repeating her offers of service, and
      protestations of faithful regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accompanied them to the chaise, and then went to the dining parlour,
      where she found Mr and Mrs Delvile, but saw nothing more of their son the
      whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning after breakfast, Mrs Delvile set out upon some
      leave-taking visits, and Cecilia went in a chair to Fetter-lane; here,
      already waiting for her, she met the punctual Mr Monckton, and the
      disappointed Jew, who most unwillingly was paid off, and relinquished his
      bonds; and who found in the severe and crafty Mr Monckton, another sort of
      man to deal with than the necessitous and heedless Mr Harrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was dismissed, other bonds were drawn and signed, the old
      ones were destroyed; and Cecilia, to her infinite satisfaction, had no
      creditor but Mr Monckton. Her bookseller, indeed, was still unpaid, but
      her debt with him was public, and gave her not any uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now, with the warmest expressions of gratitude, took leave of Mr
      Monckton, who suffered the most painful struggles in repressing the
      various apprehensions to which the parting, and her establishment at the
      Delviles gave rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then enquired briefly into the affairs of Mrs Hill, and having heard a
      satisfactory account of them, returned to St James's-square.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER i. &mdash; A DEBATE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was still early, and Mrs Delvile was not expected till late. Cecilia,
      therefore, determined to make a visit to Miss Belfield, to whom she had
      been denied during the late disorders at Mr Harrel's, and whom she could
      not endure to mortify by quitting town without seeing, since whatever were
      her doubts about Delvile, of her she had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Portland-street, therefore, she ordered her chair, deliberating as she
      went whether it were better to adhere to the reserve she had hitherto
      maintained, or to satisfy her perplexity at once by an investigation into
      the truth. And still were these scruples undecided, when, looking in at
      the windows as she passed them to the door of the house, she perceived
      Miss Belfield standing in the parlour with a letter in her hand, which she
      was fervently pressing to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck by this sight, a thousand painful conjectures occurred to her, all
      representing that the letter was from Delvile, and all explaining to his
      dishonour the mystery of his late conduct. And far were her suspicions
      from diminishing, when, upon being shown into the parlour, Miss Belfield,
      trembling with her eagerness to hide it, hastily forced the letter into
      her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, surprised, dismayed, alarmed, stopt involuntarily at the door;
      but Miss Belfield, having secured what was so evidently precious to her,
      advanced, though not without blushing, and taking her hand, said &ldquo;How good
      this is of you, madam, to come to me! when I did not know where to find
      you, and when I was almost afraid I should have found you no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then told her, that the first news she had heard the preceding
      morning, was the violent death of Mr Harrel, which had been related to
      her, with all its circumstances, by the landlord of their lodgings, who
      was himself one of his principal creditors, and had immediately been at
      Portman-square to put in his claims; where he had learnt that all the
      family had quitted the house, which was entirely occupied by bailiffs.
      &ldquo;And I was so sorry,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that you should meet with any
      hardships, and not know where to go, and have another home to seek, when I
      am sure the commonest beggar would never want an habitation, if you had
      one in your power to give him!&mdash;But how sad and melancholy you look!
      I am afraid this bad action of Mr Harrel has made you quite unhappy? Ah
      madam! you are too good for this guilty world! your own compassion and
      benevolence will not suffer you to rest in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, touched by this tender mistake of her present uneasiness,
      embraced her, and with much kindness, answered, &ldquo;No, sweet Henrietta! it
      is <i>you</i> who are good, who are innocent, who are guileless!&mdash;<i>you</i>,
      too, I hope are happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are not you, madam?&rdquo; cried Henrietta, fondly returning her caress.
      &ldquo;Oh if you are not, who will ever deserve to be! I think I should rather
      be unhappy myself, than see you so; at least I am sure I ought, for the
      whole world may be the better for your welfare, and as to me,&mdash;who
      would care what became of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah Henrietta!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;do you speak sincerely? do you indeed
      think yourself so little valued?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I don't say,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;but that I hope there are some who think
      a little kindly of me, for if I had not that hope, I should wish to break
      my heart and die! but what is that to the love and reverence so many have
      for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Cecilia, with a forced smile, &ldquo;I should put your love and
      reverence to the proof? do you think they would stand it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, indeed I do! and I have wished a thousand and a thousand times
      that I could but shew you my affection, and let you see that I did not
      love you because you were a great lady, and high in the world, and full of
      power to do me service, but because you were so good and so kind, so
      gentle to the unfortunate, and so sweet to every body!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, hold,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;and let me try if indeed, fairly and truly,
      you will answer what I mean to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; cried she warmly, &ldquo;if it is the dearest secret I have in the
      world! there is nothing I will not tell you; I will open my whole heart to
      you, and I shall be proud to think you will let me trust you, for I am
      sure if you did not care a little for me, you would not take such a
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are indeed a sweet creature!&rdquo; said Cecilia, hesitating whether or not
      to take advantage of her frankness, &ldquo;and every time I see you, I love you
      better. For the world would I not injure you,&mdash;and perhaps your
      confidence&mdash;I know not, indeed, if it is fair or right to exact it&mdash;&rdquo;
       she stopt, extremely perplext, and while Henrietta waited her further
      enquiries, they were interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Belfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Child,&rdquo; cried she, to her daughter, &ldquo;you might have let me know
      before now who was here, when you knew so well how much I wished an
      opportunity to see the young lady myself; but here you come down upon
      pretence to see your brother, and then stay away all the morning, doing
      nobody knows what.&rdquo; Then, turning to Cecilia, &ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I
      have been in the greatest concern in the world for the little accident
      that happened when I saw you before; for to be sure I thought, and indeed
      nobody will persuade me to the contrary, that it was rather an odd thing
      for such a young lady as you to come so often after Henny, without so much
      as thinking of any other reason; especially when, to be sure, there's no
      more comparison between her and my son, than between anything in the
      world; however, if it is so, it is so, and I mean to say no more about it,
      and to be sure he's as contented to think so as if he was as mere an
      insignificant animal as could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This matter, madam,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;has so long been settled, that I am
      sorry you should trouble yourself to think of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ma'am, I only mention it by the way of making the proper apology, for
      as to taking any other notice of it, I have quite left it off; though to
      be sure what I think I think; but as to my son, he has so got the upper
      hand of me, that it all goes for nothing, and I might just as well sing to
      him. Not that I mean to find fault with him neither; so pray, ma'am, don't
      let what I say be to his prejudice, for I believe all the time, there's
      nobody like him, neither at this end of the town nor the other; for as to
      the other, he has more the look of a lord, by half, than of a shopman, and
      the reason's plain, for that's the sort of company he's always kept, as I
      daresay a lady such as you must have seen long ago. But for all that,
      there's some little matters that we mothers fancy we can see into as well
      as our children; however, if they don't think so, why it answers no
      purpose to dispute; for as to a better son, to be sure there never was
      one, and that, as I always say, is the best sign I know for making a good
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this discourse, Henrietta was in the utmost confusion, dreading
      lest the grossness of her mother should again send off Cecilia in anger;
      but Cecilia, who perceived her uneasiness, and who was more charmed with
      her character than ever, from the simplicity of her sincerity, determined
      to save her that pain, by quietly hearing her harangue, and then quietly
      departing; though she was much provoked to find from the complaining hints
      every instant thrown out, that Mrs Belfield was still internally convinced
      her son's obstinate bashfulness was the only obstacle to his chusing whom
      he pleased; and that though she no longer dared speak her opinion with
      openness, she was fully persuaded Cecilia was at his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for that reason,&rdquo; continued Mrs Belfield, &ldquo;to be sure any lady that
      knew her own true advantage, could do nothing better than to take the
      recommendation of a mother, who must naturally know more of her own
      children's disposition than can be expected from a stranger; and as to
      such a son as mine, perhaps there a'n't two such in the world, for he's
      had a gentleman's education, and turn him which way he will, he'll see
      never a handsomer person than his own; though, poor dear love, he was
      always of the thinnest. But the misfortunes he's had to struggle with
      would make nobody fatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she was interrupted, and Cecilia not a little surprised, by the
      entrance of Mr Hobson and Mr Simkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; cried Mr Hobson, whom she soon found was Mrs Belfield's
      landlord; &ldquo;I would not go up stairs without just stopping to let you know
      a little how the world goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then perceiving and recollecting Cecilia, he exclaimed &ldquo;I am proud to see
      you again, ma'am,&mdash;Miss, I believe I should say, for I take it you
      are too young a lady to be entered into matrimony yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matrimony?&rdquo; cried Mr Simkins, &ldquo;no, to be sure, Mr Hobson, how can you be
      so out of the way? the young lady looks more like to a Miss from a
      boarding-school, if I might take the liberty for to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, more's the pity,&rdquo; cried Mrs Belfield, &ldquo;for as to young ladies waiting
      and waiting, I don't see the great good of it; especially if a proper
      match offers; for as to a good husband, I think no lady should be above
      accepting him, if he's modest and well-behaved, and has been brought up
      with a genteel education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why as to that, ma'am,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, &ldquo;it's another guess matter, for
      as to the lady's having a proper spouse, if I may be so free, I think as
      it's no bad thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now, taking Henrietta's hand, was wishing her good morning; but
      hearing Mr Hobson say he was just come from Portman-square, her curiosity
      was excited, and she stayed a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sad work, ma'am,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;who'd have thought Mr Harrel asked us all to
      supper for the mere purpose of such a thing as that! just to serve for a
      blind, as one may say. But when a man's conscience is foul, what I say is
      it's ten to one but he makes away with himself. Let every man keep clear
      of the world, that's my notion, and then he will be in no such hurry to
      get out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed, ma'am,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, advancing with many bows to Cecilia,
      &ldquo;humbly craving pardon for the liberty, I can't pretend for to say I think
      Mr Harrel did quite the honourable thing by us; for as to his making us
      drink all that champagne, and the like, it was a sheer take in, so that if
      I was to speak my mind, I can't say as I esteem it much of a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs Belfield, &ldquo;nothing's to me so surprising as a person's
      being his own executioner, for as to me, if I was to die for it fifty
      times, I don't think I could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here,&rdquo; resumed Mr Hobson, &ldquo;we're all defrauded of our dues! nobody's
      able to get his own, let him have worked for it ever so hard. Sad doings
      in the square, Miss! all at sixes and sevens; for my part I came off from
      Vauxhall as soon as the thing had happened, hoping to get the start of the
      others, or else I should have been proud to wait upon you, ladies, with
      the particulars; but a man of business never stands upon ceremony, for
      when money's at stake, that's out of the question. However, I was too
      late, for the house was seized before ever I could get nigh it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, ma'am, if I may be so free,&rdquo; said Mr Simkins, again profoundly
      bowing, &ldquo;that you and the other lady did not take it much amiss my not
      coming back to you, for it was not out of no disrespect, but only I got so
      squeezed in by the ladies and gentlemen that was looking on, that I could
      not make my way out, do what I could. But by what I see, I must needs say
      if one's never in such genteel company, people are always rather of the
      rudest when one's in a crowd, for if one begs and prays never so, there's
      no making 'em conformable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;is it likely any thing will remain for Mrs Harrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain, ma'am?&rdquo; repeated Mr Hobson, &ldquo;Yes, a matter of a hundred bills
      without a receipt to 'em! To be sure, ma'am, I don't want to affront you,
      that was his intimate acquaintance, more especially as you've done nothing
      disrespectful by me, which is more than I can say for Mrs Harrel, who
      seemed downright ashamed of me, and of Mr Simkins too, though all things
      considered, it would have been as well for her not to have been quite so
      high. But of that in its proper season!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, Mr Hobson fie,&rdquo; cried the supple Mr Simkins, &ldquo;how can you be so
      hard? for my share, I must needs own I think the poor lady's to be pitied;
      for it must have been but a melancholy sight to her, to see her spouse cut
      off so in the flower of his youth, as one may say; and you ought to scorn
      to take exceptions at a lady's proudness when she's in so much trouble. To
      be sure, I can't say myself as she was over-complaisant to make us
      welcome; but I hope I am above being so unpitiful as for to owe her a
      grudge for it now she's so down in the mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let everybody be civil!&rdquo; cried Mr Hobson, &ldquo;that's my notion; and then I
      shall be as much above being unpitiful as anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs Harrel,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;was then too unhappy, and is now, surely, too
      unfortunate, to make it possible any resentment should be harboured
      against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak, ma'am, like a lady of sense,&rdquo; returned Mr Hobson, &ldquo;and,
      indeed, that's the character I hear of you; but for all that, ma'am, every
      body's willing to stand up for their own friends, for which reason, ma'am,
      to be sure you'll be making the best of it, both for the Relict, and the
      late gentleman himself; but, ma'am, if I was to make bold to speak my mind
      in a fair manner, what I should say would be this; a man here to go
      shooting himself with all his debts unpaid, is a mere piece of scandal,
      ma'am! I beg pardon, but what I say is, the truth's the truth, and I can't
      call it by no other nomination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now, finding she had not any chance of pacifying him, rang for her
      servant and chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Simkins then, affecting to lower his voice, said reproachfully to his
      friend &ldquo;Indeed, Mr Hobson, to speak ingenusly, I must needs say I don't
      think it over and above pelite in you to be so hard upon the young lady's
      acquaintance that was, now he's defunct. To be sure I can't pretend for to
      deny but he behaved rather comical; for not paying of nobody, nor so much
      as making one a little compliment, or the like, though he made no bones of
      taking all one's goods, and always chused to have the prime of every
      thing, why it's what I can't pretend to stand up for. But that's neither
      here nor there, for if he had behaved as bad again, poor Miss could not
      tell how to help it; and I dares to say she had no more hand in it than
      nobody at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, to be sure,&rdquo; cried Mrs Belfield, &ldquo;what should she have to do with it?
      Do you suppose a young lady of her fortune would want to take advantage of
      a person in trade? I am sure it would be both a shame and a sin if she
      did, for if she has not money enough, I wonder who has. And for my part, I
      think when a young lady has such a fine fortune as that, the only thing
      she has to do, is to be thinking of making a good use of it, by dividing
      it, as one may say, with a good husband. For as to keeping it all for
      herself, I dare say she's a lady of too much generosity; and as to only
      marrying somebody that's got as much of his own, why it is not half so
      much a favour; and if the young lady would take my advice, she'd marry for
      love, for as to lucre, she's enough in all conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to all that,&rdquo; said Mr Hobson, &ldquo;it makes no alteration in my argument;
      I am speaking to the purpose, and not for the matter of complaisance; and
      therefore I'm bold to say Mr Harrel's action had nothing of the gentleman
      in it. A man has a right to his own life, you'll tell me; but what of
      that? that's no argument at all, for it does not give him a bit the more
      right to my property; and a man's running in debt, and spending other
      people's substances, for no reason in the world but just because he can
      blow out his own brains when he's done,&mdash;though it's a thing neither
      lawful nor religious to do,&mdash;why it's acting quite out of character,
      and a great hardship to trade into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heartily wish it had been otherwise,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;but I still hope,
      if any thing can be done for Mrs Harrel, you will not object to such a
      proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am, as I said before,&rdquo; returned Mr Hobson, &ldquo;I see you're a lady of
      sense, and for that I honour you; but as to any thing being done, it's
      what I call a distinct thing. What's mine is mine, and what's another
      man's is his; that's my way of arguing; but then if he takes what's mine,
      where's the law to hinder my taking what's his? This is what I call
      talking to the purpose. Now as to a man's cutting his throat, or the like
      of that, for blowing out his own brains may be called the self-same thing,
      what are his creditors the better for that? nothing at all, but so much
      the worse it's a false notion to respect it, for there's no respect in it;
      it's contrary to law, and a prejudice against religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree entirely in your opinion,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;but still Mrs Harrel&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your argument, ma'am,&rdquo; interrupted Mr Hobson; &ldquo;Mrs Harrel i'n't
      the worse for her husband's being shot through the head, because she was
      no accessory to the same, and for that reason, it's a hardship she should
      lose all her substance; this, ma'am, is what I say, speaking to your side
      of the argument. But now, ma'am, please to take notice what I argue upon
      the reply; what have we creditors to do with a man's family? Suppose I am
      a cabinet-maker? When I send in my chairs, do I ask who is to sit upon
      them? No; it's all one to me whether it's the gentleman's progeny or his
      friends, I must be paid for the chairs the same, use them who may. That's
      the law, ma'am, and no man need be ashamed to abide by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth of this speech palliating its sententious absurdity, made
      Cecilia give up her faint attempt to soften him; and her chair being
      ready, she arose to take leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lack-a-day, ma'am,&rdquo; cried Mrs Belfield, &ldquo;I hope you won't go yet, for I
      expect my son home soon, and I've a heap of things to talk to you about
      besides, only Mr Hobson having so much to say stopt my mouth. But I should
      take it as a great favour, ma'am, if you would come some afternoon and
      drink a dish of tea with me, for then we should have time to say all our
      say. And I'm sure, ma'am, if you would only let one of your footmen just
      take a run to let me know when you'd come, my son would be very proud to
      give you the meeting; and the servants can't have much else to do at your
      house, for where there's such a heap of 'em, they commonly think of
      nothing all day long but standing and gaping at one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out of town to-morrow,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;and therefore cannot
      have the pleasure of calling upon Miss Belfield again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then slightly courtsied, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle Henrietta, her eyes swimming in tears, followed her to her
      chair; but she followed her not alone, Mrs Belfield also attended,
      repining very loudly at the unlucky absence of her son; and the cringing
      Mr Simkins, creeping after her and bowing, said in a low voice, &ldquo;I humbly
      crave pardon, ma'am, for the liberty, but I hope you won't think as I have
      any share in Mr Hobson's behaving so rude, for I must needs say, I don't
      think it over genteel in no shape.&rdquo; And Mr Hobson himself, bent upon
      having one more sentence heard, called out, even after she was seated in
      her chair, &ldquo;All I say, ma'am, is this; let every man be honest; that's
      what I argue, and that's my notion of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia still reached home before Mrs Delvile; but most uneasy were her
      sensations, and most unquiet was her heart; the letter she had seen in the
      hands of Henrietta seemed to corroborate all her former suspicions, since
      if it came not from one infinitely dear to her she would not have shewn
      such fondness for it, and if that one was not dear to her in secret, she
      would not have concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where then was the hope that any but Delvile could have written it? in <i>secret</i>
      she could not cherish <i>two</i>, and that Delvile was cherished most
      fondly, the artlessness of her character unfitted her for disguising.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why should he write to her? what was his pretence? That he loved her
      she could now less than ever believe, since his late conduct to herself,
      though perplexing and inconsistent, evinced at least a partiality
      incompatible with a passion for another. What then, could she infer, but
      that he had seduced her affections, and ruined her peace, for the idle and
      cruel gratification of temporary vanity?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if such,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;is the depravity of this accomplished
      hypocrite, if such is the littleness of soul that a manner so noble
      disguises, shall be next, urged, perhaps, rather by prudence than
      preference, make <i>me</i> the object of his pursuit, and the food of his
      vain-glory? And shall <i>I</i>, warned and instructed as I am, be as easy
      a prey and as wretched a dupe? No, I will be better satisfied with his
      conduct, before I venture to trust him, and since I am richer than
      Henrietta and less likely to be deserted, when won, I will be more on my
      guard to know why I am addressed, and vindicate the rights of innocence,
      if I find she has been thus deluded, by forgetting his talents in his
      treachery, and renouncing him for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the reflections and surmises that dampt all the long-sought
      pleasure of her change of residence, and made her habitation in St
      James's-square no happier than it had been at Mr Harrel's!
    </p>
    <p>
      She dined again with only Mr and Mrs Delvile, and did not see their son
      all day; which, in her present uncertainty what to think of him, was an
      absence she scarcely regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servants retired, Mr Delvile told her that he had that morning
      received two visits upon her account, both from admirers, who each
      pretended to having had leave to wait upon her from Mr Harrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then named Sir Robert Floyer and Mr Marriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, indeed,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;that neither of them were treated
      perfectly well; to me, however, their own behaviour has by no means been
      strictly honourable. I have always, when referred to, been very explicit;
      and what other methods they were pleased to take, I cannot wonder should
      fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told them,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, &ldquo;that, since you were now under my roof, I
      could not refuse to receive their proposals, especially as there would be
      no impropriety in your alliance with either of them but I told them, at
      the same time, that I could by no means think of pressing their suit, as
      that was an office which, however well it might do for Mr Harrel, would be
      totally improper and unbecoming for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly;&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;and permit me, Sir, to entreat that, should
      they again apply to you, they may be wholly discouraged from repeating
      their visits, and assured that far from having trifled with them hitherto,
      the resolutions I have declared will never be varied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;to see so much spirit and discernment
      where arts of all sorts will be practised to ensnare and delude. Fortune
      and independence were never so securely lodged as in Miss Beverley, and I
      doubt not but her choice, whenever it is decided, will reflect as much
      honour upon her heart, as her difficulty in making it does upon her
      understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile then enquired whether she had fixed upon any person to choose
      as a guardian in the place of Mr Harrel. No, she said, nor should she,
      unless it were absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;your affairs will not much miss
      him! Since I have heard of the excess of his extravagance, I have
      extremely rejoiced in the uncommon prudence and sagacity of his fair ward,
      who, in such dangerous hands, with less penetration and sound sense, might
      have been drawn into a thousand difficulties, and perhaps defrauded of
      half her fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia received but little joy from this most unseasonable compliment,
      which, with many of the same sort that were frequently, though
      accidentally made, intimidated her from the confession she had planned and
      finding nothing but censure was likely to follow the discovery, she at
      length determined to give it up wholly, unless any connection should take
      place which might render necessary its avowal. Yet something she could not
      but murmur, that an action so detrimental to her own interest, and which,
      at the time, appeared indispensable to her benevolence, should now be
      considered as a mark of such folly and imprudence that she did not dare
      own it.

      CHAPTER ii. &mdash; A RAILING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning the family purposed setting off as soon as breakfast was
      over; young Delvile, however, waited not so long; the fineness of the
      weather tempted him, he said, to travel on horse-back, and therefore he
      had risen very early, and was already gone. Cecilia could not but wonder,
      yet did not repine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as breakfast was over, and Mr and Mrs Delvile and Cecilia were
      preparing to depart, to their no little surprise, the door was opened,
      and, out of breath with haste and with heat, in stumpt Mr Briggs! &ldquo;So,&rdquo;
       cried he to Cecilia, &ldquo;what's all this? hay?&mdash;where are you going?&mdash;a
      coach at the door! horses to every wheel! Servants fine as lords! what's
      in the wind now? think to chouse me out of my belongings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, who instantly understood him, though Mr
      and Mrs Delvile stared at him in utter astonishment, &ldquo;I had explained
      before I left you that I should not return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't, didn't!&rdquo; answered he, angrily; &ldquo;waited for you three days,
      dressed a breast o' mutton o' purpose; got in a lobster, and two crabs;
      all spoilt by keeping; stink already; weather quite muggy, forced to souse
      'em in vinegar; one expense brings on another; never begin the like agen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, indeed,&rdquo; said Cecilia, much disconcerted, &ldquo;if there has
      been any mistake through my neglect; but I had hoped I was understood, and
      I have been so much occupied&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;fine work! rare doings! a merry Vauxhalling,
      with pistols at all your noddles! thought as much! thought he'd tip the
      perch; saw he wasn't stanch; knew he'd go by his company,&mdash;a set of
      jackanapes! all blacklegs! nobody warm among 'em; fellows with a month's
      good living upon their backs, and not sixpence for the hangman in their
      pockets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile now, with a look of arch congratulation at Cecilia as the
      object of this agreeable visit, finding it not likely to be immediately
      concluded, returned to her chair; but Mr Delvile, leaning sternly upon his
      cane, moved not from the spot where he stood at his entrance, but surveyed
      him from head to foot, with the most astonished contempt at his undaunted
      vulgarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I'd all your cash myself; seized that, else!&mdash;run out the
      constable for you, next, and made you blow out your brains for company.
      Mind what I say, never give your mind to a gold lace hat! many a one wears
      it don't know five farthings from twopence. A good man always wears a bob
      wig; make that your rule. Ever see Master Harrel wear such a thing? No,
      I'll warrant! better if he had; kept his head on his own shoulders. And
      now, pray, how does he cut up? what has he left behind him? a <i>twey</i>-case,
      I suppose, and a bit of a hat won't go on a man's head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, perceiving, with great confusion, that Mr Delvile, though
      evidently provoked by this intrusion, would not deign to speak, that Mr
      Briggs might be regarded as belonging wholly to herself, hastily said &ldquo;I
      will not, Sir, as your time is precious, detain you here, but, as soon as
      it is in my power, I will wait upon you in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Briggs, however, without listening to her, thought proper to continue
      his harangue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invited me once to his house; sent me a card, half of it printed like a
      book! t'other half a scrawl could not read; pretended to give a supper;
      all a mere bam; went without my dinner, and got nothing to eat; all glass
      and shew; victuals painted all manner of colours; lighted up like a
      pastry-cook on twelfth-day; wanted something solid, and got a great lump
      of sweetmeat; found it as cold as a stone, all froze in my mouth like ice;
      made me jump again, and brought the tears in my eyes; forced to spit it
      out; believe it was nothing but a snowball, just set up for show, and
      covered over with a little sugar. Pretty way to spend money! Stuffing, and
      piping, and hopping! never could rest till every farthing was gone;
      nothing left but his own fool's pate, and even that he could not hold
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;we are all going out of town; the
      carriage is waiting at the door, and therefore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;Sha'n't go; come for you myself; take you to
      my own house. Got every thing ready, been to the broker's, bought a nice
      blanket, hardly a brack in it. Pick up a table soon; one in my eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you have so totally mistaken me, Sir; for I am now going into
      the country with Mr and Mrs Delvile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't consent, won't consent! what will you go there for? hear of nothing
      but dead dukes; as well visit an old tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Delvile, who felt himself insulted in a manner he could least
      support, after looking at him very disdainfully, turned to Cecilia, and
      said &ldquo;Miss Beverley, if this person wishes for a longer conference with
      you, I am sorry you did not appoint a more seasonable hour for your
      interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; cried the impenetrable Mr Briggs; &ldquo;want to hurry her off! see
      that! But 't won't do; a'n't to be nicked; chuse to come in for my thirds;
      won't be gulled, sha'n't have more than your share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile, with a look meant to be nothing less than
      petrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried he, with an arch leer; &ldquo;all above it, hay? warrant your
      Spanish Don never thinks of such a thing! don't believe 'em my duck! great
      cry and little wool; no more of the ready than other folks; mere puff and
      go one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is language, Sir,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, &ldquo;so utterly incomprehensible,
      that I presume you do not even intend it should be understood; otherwise,
      I should very little scruple to inform you, that no man of the name of
      Delvile brooks the smallest insinuation of dishonour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't he?&rdquo; returned Mr Briggs, with a grin; &ldquo;why how will he help it?
      will the old grandees jump up out of their graves to frighten us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What old grandees, Sir? to whom are you pleased to allude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why all them old grandfathers and aunts you brag of; a set of poor souls
      you won't let rest in their coffins; mere clay and dirt! fine things to be
      proud of! a parcel of old mouldy rubbish quite departed this life! raking
      up bones and dust, nobody knows for what! ought to be ashamed; who cares
      for dead carcases? nothing but [carrion]. My little Tom's worth forty of
      'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can so ill make out, Miss Beverley,&rdquo; said the astonished Mr Delvile,
      &ldquo;what this person is pleased to dive at, that I cannot pretend to enter
      into any sort of conversation with him; you will therefore be so good as
      to let me know when he has finished his discourse, and you are at leisure
      to set off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a very stately air, he was quitting the room; but was soon
      stopt, upon Mr Briggs calling out &ldquo;Ay, ay, Don Duke, poke in the old
      charnel houses by yourself, none of your defunct for me! didn't care if
      they were all hung in a string. Who's the better for 'em?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Sir,&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile, turning round, &ldquo;to whom were you pleased to
      address that speech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To one Don Puffendorff,&rdquo; replied Mr Briggs; &ldquo;know ever such a person,
      hay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don who? Sir!&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, stalking nearer to him, &ldquo;I must trouble
      you to say that name over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose don't chuse it? how then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to blame,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, scornfully waving his hand with a
      repulsive motion, &ldquo;to suffer myself to be irritated so unworthily; and I
      am sorry, in my own house, to be compelled to hint that the sooner I have
      it to myself, the better I shall be contented with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, want to get me off; want to have her to yourself! won't be so
      soon choused; who's the better man? hay? which do you think is warmest?
      and all got by myself; obliged to never a grandee for a penny; what do you
      say to that? will you cast an account with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very extraordinary this!&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile; &ldquo;the most extraordinary
      circumstance of the kind I ever met with! a person to enter my house in
      order to talk in this incomprehensible manner! a person, too, I hardly
      know by sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, old Don,&rdquo; cried Briggs, with a facetious nod, &ldquo;Know me better
      another time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old who, Sir!&mdash;what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to a fair reckoning,&rdquo; continued Mr Briggs; &ldquo;suppose you were in my
      case, and had never a farthing but of your own getting; where would you be
      then? What would become of your fine coach and horses? you might stump
      your feet off before you'd ever get into one. Where would be all this fine
      crockery work for your breakfast? you might pop your head under a pump, or
      drink out of your own paw; what would you do for that fine jemmy tye?
      Where would you get a gold head to your stick?&mdash;You might dig long
      enough in them cold vaults before any of your old grandfathers would pop
      out to give you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile, feeling more enraged than he thought suited his dignity,
      restrained himself from making any further answer, but going up to the
      bell, rang it with great violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as to ringing a bell,&rdquo; continued Mr Briggs, &ldquo;you'd never know what it
      was in your life, unless could make interest to be a dust-man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dust-man!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated Mr Delvile, unable to command his silence
      longer, &ldquo;I protest&rdquo;&mdash;and biting his lips, he stopt short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, love it, don't you? suits your taste; why not one dust as well as
      another? Dust in a cart good as dust of a charnel-house; don't smell half
      so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant now entering, Mr Delvile called out &ldquo;Is everything ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then begged Mrs Delvile to go into the coach, and telling Cecilia to
      follow when at leisure, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come immediately, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;Mr Briggs, I am sorry to
      leave you, and much concerned you have had this trouble; but I can detain
      Mr Delvile no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then away she ran, notwithstanding he repeatedly charged her to stay.
      He followed them, however, to the coach, with bitter revilings that every
      body was to make more of his ward than himself, and with the most virulent
      complaints of his losses from the blanket, the breast of mutton, the crabs
      and the lobster!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, however, more was said to him; Cecilia, as if she had not heard
      him, only bowed her head, and the coach driving off, they soon lost sight
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident by no means rendered the journey pleasant, or Mr Delvile
      gracious; his own dignity, that constant object of his thoughts and his
      cares, had received a wound from this attack which he had not the sense to
      despise; and the vulgarity and impudence of Mr Briggs, which ought to have
      made his familiarity and boldness equally contemptible and ridiculous,
      served only with a man whose pride out-ran his understanding, to render
      them doubly mortifying and stinging. He could talk, therefore, of nothing
      the whole way that they went, but the extreme impropriety of which the
      Dean of had been guilty, in exposing him to scenes and situations so much
      beneath his rank, by leaguing him with a person so coarse and disgraceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slept one night upon the road, and arrived the next day at Delvile
      Castle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER iii. &mdash; AN ANTIQUE MANSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Delvile Castle was situated in a large and woody park, and surrounded by a
      moat. A drawbridge which fronted the entrance was every night, by order of
      Mr Delvile, with the same care as if still necessary for the preservation
      of the family, regularly drawn up. Some fortifications still remained
      entire, and vestiges were every where to be traced of more; no taste was
      shown in the disposition of the grounds, no openings were contrived
      through the wood for distant views or beautiful objects; the mansion-house
      was ancient, large and magnificent, but constructed with as little
      attention to convenience and comfort, as to airiness and elegance; it was
      dark, heavy and monastic, equally in want of repair and of improvement.
      The grandeur of its former inhabitants was every where visible, but the
      decay into which it was falling rendered such remains mere objects for
      meditation and melancholy; while the evident struggle to support some
      appearance of its ancient dignity, made the dwelling and all in its
      vicinity wear an aspect of constraint and austerity. Festivity, joy and
      pleasure, seemed foreign to the purposes of its construction; silence,
      solemnity and contemplation were adapted to it only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, however, took all possible care to make the apartments and
      situation of Cecilia commodious and pleasant, and to banish by her
      kindness and animation the gloom and formality which her mansion inspired.
      Nor were her efforts ungratefully received; Cecilia, charmed by every mark
      of attention from a woman she so highly admired, returned her solicitude
      by encreasing affection, and repaid all her care by the revival of her
      spirits. She was happy, indeed, to have quitted the disorderly house of Mr
      Harrel, where terror, so continually awakened, was only to be lulled by
      the grossest imposition; and though her mind, depressed by what was
      passed, and in suspence with what was to come, was by no means in a state
      for uninterrupted enjoyment, yet to find herself placed, at last, without
      effort or impropriety, in the very mansion she had so long considered as
      her road to happiness, rendered her, notwithstanding her remaining sources
      of inquietude, more contented than she had yet felt herself since her
      departure from Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the imperious Mr Delvile was more supportable here than in London;
      secure in his own castle, he looked around him with a pride of power and
      of possession which softened while it swelled him. His superiority was
      undisputed, his will was without controul. He was not, as in the great
      capital of the kingdom, surrounded by competitors; no rivalry disturbed
      his peace, no equality mortified his greatness; all he saw were either
      vassals of his power, or guests bending to his pleasure; he abated
      therefore, considerably, the stern gloom of his haughtiness, and soothed
      his proud mind by the courtesy of condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little, however, was the opportunity Cecilia found, for evincing that
      spirit and forbearance she had planned in relation to Delvile; he
      breakfasted by himself every morning, rode or walked out alone till driven
      home by the heat of the day, and spent the rest of his time till dinner in
      his own study. When he then appeared, his conversation was always general,
      and his attention not more engaged by Cecilia than by his mother. Left by
      them with his father, sometimes he appeared again at tea-time, but more
      commonly he rode or strolled out to some neighbouring family, and it was
      always uncertain whether he was again seen before dinner the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this conduct, reserve on her part was rendered totally unnecessary; she
      could give no discouragement where she met with no assiduity; she had no
      occasion to fly where she was never pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange, however, she thought such behaviour, and utterly impossible to be
      the effect of accident; his desire to avoid her seemed scrupulous and
      pointed, and however to the world it might wear the appearance of chance,
      to her watchful anxiety a thousand circumstances marked it for design. She
      found that his friends at home had never seen so little of him, complaints
      were continually made of his frequent absences, and much surprise was
      expressed at his new manner of life, and what might be the occupations
      which so strangely engrossed his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had her heart not interfered in this matter, she might now have been
      perfectly at rest, since she was spared the renunciation she had
      projected, and since, without either mental exertion or personal trouble,
      the affair seemed totally dropt, and Delvile, far from manifesting any
      design of conquest, shunned all occasions of gallantry, and sedulously
      avoided even common conversation with her. If he saw her preparing to walk
      out in an evening, he was certain to stay at home; if his mother was with
      her, and invited him to join them, he was sure to be ready with some other
      engagement; and if by accident he met her in the park, he merely stopt to
      speak of the weather, bowed, and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to reconcile a coldness so extraordinary with a fervour so animated as
      that which he had lately shewn, was indeed not easy; sometimes she fancied
      he had entangled not only the poor Henrietta but himself, at other times
      she believed him merely capricious; but that he studied to avoid her she
      was convinced invariably, and such a conviction was alone sufficient to
      determine her upon forwarding his purpose. And, when her first surprise
      was over, and first chagrin abated, her own pride came to her aid, and she
      resolved to use every method in her power to conquer a partiality so un
      gratefully bestowed. She rejoiced that in no instance she had ever
      betrayed it, and she saw that his own behaviour prevented all suspicion of
      it in the family. Yet, in the midst of her mortification and displeasure,
      she found some consolation in seeing that those mercenary views of which
      she had once been led to accuse him, were farthest from his thoughts, and
      that whatever was the state of his mind, she had no artifice to apprehend,
      nor design to guard against. All therefore that remained was to imitate
      his example, be civil and formal, shun all interviews that were not
      public, and decline all discourse but what good breeding occasionally made
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      By these means their meetings became more rare than ever, and of shorter
      duration, for if one by any accident was detained, the other retired;
      till, by their mutual diligence, they soon only saw each other at dinner;
      and though neither of them knew the motives or the intentions of the
      other, the best concerted agreement could not more effectually have
      separated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This task to Cecilia was at first extremely painful; but time and
      constancy of mind soon lessened its difficulty. She amused herself with
      walking and reading, she commissioned Mr Monckton to send her a Piano
      Forte of Merlin's, she was fond of fine work, and she found in the
      conversation of Mrs Delvile a never-failing resource against languor and
      sadness. Leaving therefore to himself her mysterious son, she wisely
      resolved to find other employment for her thoughts, than conjectures with
      which she could not be satisfied, and doubts that might never be
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few families visited at the castle, and fewer still had their visits
      returned. The arrogance of Mr Delvile had offended all the neighbouring
      gentry, who could easily be better entertained than by receiving
      instructions of their own inferiority, which however readily they might
      allow, was by no means so pleasant a subject as to recompense them for
      hearing no other. And if Mr Delvile was shunned through hatred, his lady
      no less was avoided through fear; high-spirited and fastidious, she was
      easily wearied and disgusted, she bore neither with frailty nor folly&mdash;those
      two principal ingredients in human nature! She required, to obtain her
      favour, the union of virtue and abilities with elegance, which meeting but
      rarely, she was rarely disposed to be pleased; and disdaining to conceal
      either contempt or aversion, she inspired in return nothing but dread or
      resentment; making thus, by a want of that lenity which is the <i>milk of
      human kindness</i>, and the bond of society, enemies the most numerous and
      illiberal by those very talents which, more <i>meekly borne</i>, would
      have rendered her not merely admired, but adored!
    </p>
    <p>
      In proportion, however, as she was thus at war with the world in general,
      the chosen few who were honoured with her favour, she loved with a zeal
      all her own; her heart, liberal, open, and but too daringly sincere, was
      fervent in affection, and enthusiastic in admiration; the friends who were
      dear to her, she was devoted to serve, she magnified their virtues till
      she thought them of an higher race of beings, she inflamed her generosity
      with ideas of what she owed to them, till her life seemed too small a
      sacrifice to be refused for their service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the love which already she felt for Cecilia; her countenance had
      struck, her manners had charmed her, her understanding was displayed by
      the quick intelligence of her eyes, and every action and every notion
      spoke her mind the seat of elegance. In secret she sometimes regretted
      that she was not higher born, but that regret always vanished when she saw
      and conversed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own youth had been passed in all the severity of affliction; she had
      been married to Mr Delvile by her relations, without any consultation of
      her heart or her will. Her strong mind disdained useless complaints, yet
      her discontent, however private, was deep. Ardent in her disposition, and
      naturally violent in her passions, her feelings were extremely acute, and
      to curb them by reason and principle had been the chief and hard study of
      her life. The effort had calmed, though it had not made her happy. To love
      Mr Delvile she felt was impossible; proud without merit, and imperious
      without capacity, she saw with bitterness the inferiority of his
      faculties, and she found in his temper no qualities to endear or attract;
      yet she respected his birth and his family, of which her own was a branch,
      and whatever was her misery from the connection, she steadily behaved to
      him with the strictest propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son, however, when she was blessed with his presence, had a power over
      her mind that mitigated all her sorrows, and almost lulled even her wishes
      to sleep; she rather idolised than loved him, yet her fondness flowed not
      from relationship, but from his worth and his character, his talents and
      his disposition. She saw in him, indeed, all her own virtues and
      excellencies, with a toleration for the imperfections of others to which
      she was wholly a stranger. Whatever was great or good she expected him to
      perform; occasion alone she thought wanting to manifest him the first of
      human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor here was Mr Delvile himself less sanguine in his hopes; his son was
      not only the first object of his affection, but the chief idol of his
      pride, and he did not merely cherish but reverence him as his successor,
      the only support of his ancient name and family, without whose life and
      health the whole race would be extinct. He consulted him in all his
      affairs, never mentioned him but with distinction, and expected the whole
      world to bow down before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile in his behaviour to his father imitated the conduct of his mother,
      who opposed him in nothing when his pleasure was made known, but who
      forbore to enquire into his opinion except in cases of necessity. Their
      minds, indeed, were totally dissimilar; and Delvile well knew that if he
      submitted to his directions, he must demand such respect as the world
      would refuse with indignation, and scarcely speak to a man whose genealogy
      was not known to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though duty and gratitude were the only ties that bound him to his
      father, he loved his mother not merely with filial affection, but with the
      purest esteem and highest reverence; he knew, too, that while without him
      her existence would be a burthen, her tenderness was no effusion of weak
      partiality, but founded on the strongest assurances of his worth; and
      however to maternal indulgence its origin might be owing, the rectitude of
      his own conduct could alone save it from diminution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the house in which Cecilia was now settled, and with which she
      lived almost to the exclusion of the sight of any other; for though she
      had now been three weeks at the castle, she had only at church seen any
      family but the Delviles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did any thing in the course of that time occur to her, but the
      reception of a melancholy letter from Mrs Harrel, filled with complaints
      of her retirement and misery; and another, from Mr Arnott, with an account
      of the funeral, the difficulties he had had to encounter with the
      creditors, who had even seized the dead body, and the numerous expences in
      which he had been involved, by petitions he could not withstand, from the
      meaner and more clamorous of those whom his late brother-in-law had left
      unpaid. He concluded with a pathetic prayer for her happiness, and a
      declaration that his own was lost for ever, since now he was even deprived
      of her sight. Cecilia wrote an affectionate answer to Mrs Harrel,
      promising, when fully at liberty, that she would herself fetch her to her
      own house in Suffolk; but she could only send her compliments to Mr
      Arnott, though her compassion urged a kinder message; as she feared even a
      shadow of encouragement to so serious, yet hopeless a passion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER iv. &mdash; A RATTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this time, the house was much enlivened by a visit from Lady Honoria
      Pemberton, who came to spend a month with Mrs Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had now but little leisure, for Lady Honoria would hardly rest a
      moment away from her; she insisted upon walking with her, sitting with
      her, working with her, and singing with her; whatever she did, she chose
      to do also; wherever she went, she was bent upon accompanying her; and Mrs
      Delvile, who wished her well, though she had no patience with her foibles,
      encouraged this intimacy from the hope it might do her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, that Lady Honoria had conceived any regard for
      Cecilia; on the contrary, had she been told she should see her no more,
      she would have heard it with the same composure as if she had been told
      she should meet with her daily; she had no motive for pursuing her but
      that she had nothing else to do, and no fondness for her society but, what
      resulted from aversion to solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria had received a fashionable education, in which her
      proficiency had been equal to what fashion made requisite; she sung a
      little; played the harpsichord a little, painted a little, worked a
      little, and danced a great deal. She had quick parts and high spirits,
      though her mind was uncultivated, and she was totally void of judgment or
      discretion; she was careless of giving offence, and indifferent to all
      that was thought of her; the delight of her life was to create wonder by
      her rattle, and whether that wonder was to her advantage or discredit, she
      did not for a moment trouble herself to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character of so much levity with so little heart had no great chance of
      raising esteem or regard in Cecilia, who at almost any other period of her
      life would have been wearied of her importunate attendance; but at
      present, the unsettled state of her own mind made her glad to give it any
      employment, and the sprightliness of Lady Honoria served therefore to
      amuse her. Yet she could not forbear being hurt by finding that the
      behaviour of Delvile was so exactly the same to them both, that any common
      observer would with difficulty have pronounced which he preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning about a week after her ladyship's arrival at the castle, she
      came running into Cecilia's room, saying she had very good news for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming opening!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;pray tell it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why my Lord Derford is coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O what a melancholy dearth of incident,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;if this is your
      best intelligence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it's better than nothing; better than going to sleep over a family
      party; and I vow I have sometimes such difficulty to keep awake, that I am
      frightened to death lest I should be taken with a sudden nap, and affront
      them all. Now pray speak the truth without squeamishness, don't you find
      it very terrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I find nothing very terrible with Mrs Delvile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I like Mrs Delvile, too, of all things, for I believe she's the
      cleverest woman in the world; but then I know she does not like me, so
      there's no being very fond of her. Besides, really, if I admired her as
      much again, I should be, dreadfully tired of seeing nothing else. She
      never stirs out, you know, and has no company at home, which is an
      extremely tiresome plan, for it only serves to make us all doubly sick of
      one another; though you must know it's one great reason why my father
      likes I should come; for he has some very old-fashioned notions, though I
      take a great deal of pains to make him get the better of them. But I am
      always excessively rejoiced when the visit has been paid, for I am obliged
      to come every year. I don't mean <i>now</i>, indeed, because your being
      here makes it vastly more tolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me much honour,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really, when my Lord Derford comes, it can't possibly be quite so
      bad, for at least there will be something else to look at; and you must
      know my eyes tire extremely of always seeing the same objects. And we can
      ask him, too, for a little news, and that will put Mrs Delvile in a
      passion, which will help to give us a little spirit; though I know we
      shall not get the smallest intelligence from him, for he knows nothing in
      the world that's going forward. And, indeed, that's no great matter, for
      if he did, he would not know how to tell it, he's so excessively silly.
      However, I shall ask him all sort of things, for the less he can answer,
      the more it will plague him; and I like to plague a fool amazingly,
      because he can never plague one again.&mdash;Though really I ought to beg
      your pardon, for he is one of your admirers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh pray make no stranger of me! you have my free consent to say whatever
      you please of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, then, I like my old Lord Ernolf the best of the two, for he
      has a thousand times more sense than his son, and upon my word I don't
      think he is much uglier. But I wonder vastly you would not marry him, for
      all that, for you might have done exactly what you pleased with him,
      which, altogether, would have been no inconvenient circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I want a pupil,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;I shall think that an admirable
      recommendation; but were I to marry, I would rather find a tutor, of the
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I should not,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, carelessly, &ldquo;for one has
      enough to do with tutors before hand, and the best thing I know of
      marrying is to get rid of them. I fancy you think so too, only it's a
      pretty speech to make. Oh how my sister Euphrasia would adore you!&mdash;Pray
      are you always as grave as you are now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;yes,&mdash;indeed I hardly know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy it's this dismal place that hurts your spirits. I remember when I
      saw you in St James's-square I thought you very lively. But really these
      thick walls are enough to inspire the vapours if one never had them
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they have had a very bad effect upon your ladyship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes they have; if Euphrasia was here she would hardly know me. And the
      extreme want of taste and entertainment in all the family is quite
      melancholy; for even if by chance one has the good fortune to hear any
      intelligence, Mrs Delvile will hardly let it be repeated, for fear it
      should happen to be untrue, as if that could possibly signify! I am sure I
      had as lieve the things were false as not, for they tell as well one way
      as the other, if she would but have patience to hear them. But she's
      extremely severe, you know, as almost all those very clever women are; so
      that she keeps a kind of restraint upon me whether I will or no. However,
      that's nothing compared to her <i>caro sposo</i>, for he is utterly
      insufferable; so solemn, and so dull! so stately and so tiresome!
      Mortimer, too, gets worse and worse; O 'tis a sad tribe! I dare say he
      will soon grow quite as horrible as his father. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed,&mdash;no,&mdash;I don't think there's much resemblance,&rdquo; said
      Cecilia, with some hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the most altered creature,&rdquo; continued her ladyship, &ldquo;I ever saw in
      my life. Once I thought him the most agreeable young man in the world; but
      if you observe, that's all over now, and he is getting just as stupid and
      dismal as the rest of them. I wish you had been here last summer; I assure
      you, you would quite have fallen in love with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I?&rdquo; said Cecilia, with a conscious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for he was quite delightful; all spirit and gaiety, but now, if it
      was not for you, I really think I should pretend to lose my way, and
      instead of going over that old draw-bridge, throw myself into the moat. I
      wish Euphrasia was here. It's just the right place for her. She'll fancy
      herself in a monastery as soon as she comes, and nothing will make her
      half so happy, for she is always wishing to be a Nun, poor little
      simpleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any chance that Lady Euphrasia may come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, she can't at present, because it would not be proper; but I mean if
      ever she is married to Mortimer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married to him!&rdquo; repeated Cecilia, in the utmost consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, my dear,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, looking at her very archly, &ldquo;you
      intend to be married to him yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? no, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look very guilty, though,&rdquo; cried she laughing, &ldquo;and indeed when you
      came hither, every body said that the whole affair was arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Lady Honoria!&rdquo; said Cecilia, again changing colour, &ldquo;I am sure
      this must be your own fancy,&mdash;invention,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I assure you; I heard it at several places; and every body said how
      charmingly your fortune would build up all these old fortifications; but
      some people said they knew Mr Harrel had sold you to Mr Marriot, and that
      if you married Mortimer, there would be a lawsuit that would take away
      half your estate; and others said you had promised your hand to Sir Robert
      Floyer, and repented when you heard of his mortgages, and he gave it out
      every where that he would fight any man that pretended to you; and then
      again some said that you were all the time privately married to Mr Arnott,
      but did not dare own it, because he was so afraid of fighting with Sir
      Robert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lady Honoria!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, half laughing, &ldquo;what wild inventions are
      these! and all I hope, your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, they were current over the whole town. But don't take any
      notice of what I told you about Euphrasia, for perhaps, it may never
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Cecilia, reviving by believing it all fiction, &ldquo;it has
      never been in agitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes; it is negociating at this very moment, I believe, among the higher
      powers; only Mr Delvile does not yet know whether Euphrasia has fortune
      enough for what he wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, thought Cecilia, how do I rejoice that my independent situation
      exempts me from being disposed of for life, by thus being set up to sale!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They thought of me, once, for Mortimer,&rdquo; continued Lady Honoria, &ldquo;but I'm
      vastly glad that's over, for I never should have survived being shut up in
      this place; it's much fitter for Euphrasia. To tell you the truth, I
      believe they could not make out money enough; but Euphrasia has a fortune
      of her own, besides what we shall have together, for Grandmama left her
      every thing that was in her own power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Lady Euphrasia your elder sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, poor little thing, she's two years younger. Grandmama brought her
      up, and` she has seen nothing at all of the world, for she has never been
      presented yet, so she is not <i>come out</i>, you know; but she's to come
      out next year. However, she once saw Mortimer, but she did not like him at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like him!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, greatly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she thought him too gay,&mdash;Oh dear, I wish she could see him now!
      I am sure I hope she would find him sad enough! she is the most formal
      little grave thing you ever beheld; she'll preach to you sometimes for
      half an hour together. Grandmama taught her nothing in the world but to
      say her prayers, so that almost every other word you say, she thinks is
      quite wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was now interrupted by their separating to dress for
      dinner. It left Cecilia in much perplexity; she knew not what wholly to
      credit, or wholly to disbelieve; but her chief concern arose from the
      unfortunate change of countenance which Lady Honoria had been so quick in
      observing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time she was alone with Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;Miss Beverley,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;has your little rattling tormentor acquainted you who is coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Derford, do you mean, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with his father; shall you dislike to see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if, as I hope, they come merely to wait upon you and Mr Delvile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Delvile and myself,&rdquo; answered she smiling, &ldquo;will certainly have the
      honour of <i>receiving</i> them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Ernolf,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;can never suppose his visit will make any
      change in me; I have been very explicit with him, and he seemed equally
      rational and well bred in forbearing any importunity upon the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has however been much believed in town,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;that you
      were strangely shackled by Mr Harrel, and therefore his lordship may
      probably hope that a change in your situation may be followed by a change
      in his favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be sorry if he does,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;for he will then find
      himself much deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, very right,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;to be difficult in your
      choice, and to take time for looking around you before you make any. I
      have forborn all questions upon this subject, lest you should find any
      reluctance in answering them; but I am now too deeply interested in your
      welfare to be contented in total ignorance of your designs; will you,
      then, suffer me to make a few enquiries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia gave a ready, but blushing assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, then, of the many admirers who have graced your train, which
      there is you have distinguished with any intention of future preference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one, madam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, out of so many, is there not one that, hereafter, you mean to
      distinguish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah madam!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, shaking her head, &ldquo;many as they may seem, I
      have little reason to be proud of them; there is one only who, had my
      fortune been smaller, would, I believe, ever have thought of me, and there
      is one only, who, were it now diminished, would ever think of me more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sincerity,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;is just what I expected from you.
      There is, then, <i>one</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there is,&mdash;and the worthy Mr Arnott is the man; I am much
      indeed deceived, if his partiality for me is not truly disinterested, and
      I almost wish&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I could return it more gratefully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&mdash;I cannot! I esteem him, I have the truest regard for his
      character, and were I now by any fatal necessity, compelled to belong to
      any one of those who have been pleased to address me, I should not
      hesitate a moment in shewing him my gratitude; but yet, for some time at
      least, such a proof of it would render me very miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may perhaps think so now,&rdquo; returned Mrs Delvile; &ldquo;but with sentiments
      so strongly in his favour, you will probably be led hereafter to pity&mdash;and
      accept him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, madam; I pretend not, I own, to open my whole heart to you;&mdash;I
      know not that you would have patience, for so uninteresting a detail; but
      though there are some things I venture not to mention, there is nothing,
      believe me, in which I will deceive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> believe you,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, embracing her; &ldquo;and the more
      readily because, not merely among your avowed admirers, but among the
      whole race of men, I scarce know one to whom I should think you worthily
      consigned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! thought Cecilia, that scarce! who may it mean to except?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To shew you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that I will deserve your confidence in
      future, I will refrain from distressing you by any further questions at
      present; you will not, I think, act materially without consulting me, and
      for your thoughts&mdash;it were tyranny, not friendship, to investigate
      them more narrowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's gratitude for this delicacy, would instantly have induced her to
      tell every secret of her soul, had she not apprehended such a confession
      would have seemed soliciting her interest and assistance, in the only
      affair in which she would have disdained even to receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked her, therefore, for her kindness, and the conversation was
      dropt; she much wished to have known whether these enquiries sprung simply
      from friendly curiosity, or whether she was desirous from any nearer
      motive to be satisfied with respect to her freedom or engagements. This,
      however, she had no method of discovering, and was therefore compelled to
      wait quietly till time should make it clear.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER v. &mdash; A STORM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening about this time, which was the latter end of July, Lady
      Honoria and Cecilia deferred walking out till very late, and then found it
      so pleasant, that they had strolled into the Park two miles from the
      house, when they were met by young Delvile; who, however, only reminded
      them how far they had to return, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He grows quite intolerable!&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, when he was gone; &ldquo;it's
      really a melancholy thing to see a young man behave so like an old Monk. I
      dare say in another week he won't take off his hat to us; and, in about a
      fortnight, I suppose he'll shut himself up in one of those little round
      towers, and shave his head, and live upon roots, and howl if any body
      comes near him. I really half wonder he does not think it too dissipated
      to let Fidel run after him so. A thousand to one but he shoots him some
      day for giving a sudden bark when he's in one of these gloomy fits.
      Something, however, must certainly be the matter with him. Perhaps he is
      in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nothing be the matter with him but that?&rdquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I don't know; but I am sure if he is, his Mistress has not much
      occasion to be jealous of you or me, for never, I think, were two poor
      Damsels so neglected!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The utmost art of malice could not have furnished speech more truly
      mortifying to Cecilia than this thoughtless and accidental sally of Lady
      Honoria's; particularly, however, upon her guard, from the raillery she
      had already endured, she answered, with apparent indifference, &ldquo;he is
      meditating, perhaps, upon Lady Euphrasia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;for he did not take any notice of her when he
      saw her; I am sure if he marries her, it will only be because he cannot
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lady Euphrasia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, not at all; he'll make her two or three fine speeches, and then
      she'll be perfectly contented especially if he looks as dismally at her as
      he does at us! and that probably he will do the more readily for not
      liking to look at her at all. But she's such a romantic little thing,
      she'll never suspect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they were somewhat alarmed by a sudden darkness in the air, which was
      presently succeeded by a thunder storm; they instantly turned back, and
      began running home, when a violent shower of rain obliged them to take
      shelter under a large tree; where in two minutes they were joined by
      Delvile, who came to offer his assistance in hurrying them home; and
      finding the thunder and lightning continue, begged them to move on, in
      defiance of the rain, as their present situation exposed them to more
      danger than a wet hat and cloak, which might be changed in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia readily assented; but Lady Honoria, extremely frightened,
      protested she would not stir till the storm was over. It was in vain he
      represented her mistake in supposing herself in a place of security; she
      clung to the tree, screamed at every flash of lightning, and all her gay
      spirits were lost in her apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile then earnestly proposed to Cecilia conducting her home by herself,
      and returning again to Lady Honoria; but she thought it wrong to quit her
      companion, and hardly right to accept his assistance separately. They
      waited, therefore, some time all together; but the storm increasing with
      great violence, the thunder growing louder, and the lightning becoming
      stronger, Delvile grew impatient even to anger at Lady Honoria's
      resistance, and warmly expostulated upon its folly and danger. But the
      present was no season for lessons in philosophy; prejudices she had never
      been taught to surmount made her think herself in a place of safety, and
      she was now too much terrified to give argument fair play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding her thus impracticable, Delvile eagerly said to Cecilia, &ldquo;Come
      then, Miss Beverley, let us wait no longer; I will see you home, and then
      return to Lady Honoria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;my life is not more precious than either of
      yours, and therefore it may run the same risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more precious,&rdquo; cried he with vehemence, &ldquo;than the air I breathe!&rdquo;
       and seizing her hand, he drew it under his arm, and, without waiting her
      consent, almost forced her away with him, saying as they ran, &ldquo;How could a
      thousand Lady Honoria's recompense the world for the loss of one Miss
      Beverley? we may, indeed, find many thousand such as Lady Honoria, but
      such as Miss Beverley&mdash;where shall we ever find another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, surprised, yet gratified, could not speak, for the speed with
      which they ran almost took away her breath; and before they were near
      home, slackening her pace, and panting, she confessed her strength was
      exhausted, and that she could go so fast no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us then stop and rest,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;but why will you not lean upon me?
      surely this is no time for scruples, and for idle and unnecessary
      scruples, Miss Beverley can never find a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then, urged equally by shame at his speech and by weakness from
      fatigue, leant upon his arm but she soon repented her condescension; for
      Delvile, with an emotion he seemed to find wholly irrepressible,
      passionately exclaimed &ldquo;sweet lovely burthen! O why not thus for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strength of Cecilia was now instantly restored, and she hastily
      withdrew from his hold; he suffered her to disengage herself, but said in
      a faultering voice, &ldquo;pardon me, Cecilia!&mdash;Madam!&mdash;Miss Beverley,
      I mean!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, without making any answer, walked on by herself, as quick a pace
      as she was able; and Delvile, not venturing to oppose her, silently
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gone but a few steps, before there came a violent shower of hail;
      and the wind, which was very high, being immediately in their faces,
      Cecilia was so pelted and incommoded, that she was frequently obliged to
      stop, in defiance of her utmost efforts to force herself forward. Delvile
      then approaching her, proposed that she should again stand under a tree,
      as the thunder and lightning for the present seemed over, and wait there
      till the fury of the hail was past; and Cecilia, though never before so
      little disposed to oblige him, was so much distressed by the violence of
      the wind and hail, that she was forced to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every instant now seemed an age; yet neither hail nor wind abated; mean
      time they were both silent, and both, though with different feelings,
      equally comfortless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, however, who took care to place himself on the side whence the
      wind blew hardest, perceived, in spite of his endeavours to save her, some
      hail-stones lodged upon her thin summer cloak; he then took off his own
      hat, and, though he ventured not to let it touch her, held it in such a
      manner as to shelter her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now could no longer be either silent or unmoved, but turning to
      him with much emotion, said, &ldquo;Why will you do this, Mr Delvile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would I <i>not</i> do,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;to obtain forgiveness from
      Miss Beverley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&mdash;pray put on your hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you command it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly!&mdash;but I wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried he, instantly putting it on, &ldquo;whose are the commands that
      would have half the weight with your wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, after another pause, he added, &ldquo;do you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, ashamed of the cause of their dissension, and softened by the
      seriousness of his manner, answered very readily, &ldquo;yes, yes,&mdash;why
      will you make me remember such nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sweetness,&rdquo; cried he warmly, and snatching her hand, &ldquo;is Miss
      Beverley!&mdash;O that I had power&mdash;that it were not utterly
      impossible&mdash;that the cruelty of my situation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find,&rdquo; cried she, greatly agitated, and forcibly drawing away her hand,
      &ldquo;you will teach me, for another time, the folly of fearing bad weather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she hurried from beneath the tree; and Delvile perceiving one of the
      servants approach with an umbrella, went forward to take it from him, and
      directed him to hasten instantly to Lady Honoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then returning to Cecilia, he would have held it over her head, but with
      an air of displeasure, she took it into her own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not let me carry it for you?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir, there is not any occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then proceeded silently on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm was now soon over; but it grew very dark, and as they had
      quitted the path while they ran, in order to get home by a shorter cut,
      the walk was so bad from the height of the grass, and the unevenness of
      the ground, that Cecilia had the utmost difficulty to make her way; yet
      she resolutely refused any assistance from Delvile, who walked anxiously
      by her side, and seemed equally fearful upon his own account and upon
      hers, to trust himself with being importunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they came to a place which Cecilia in vain tried to pass;
      Delvile then grew more urgent to help her; firm, however, in declining all
      aid, she preferred going a considerable way round to another part of the
      park which led to the house. Delvile, angry as well as mortified, proposed
      to assist her no more, but followed without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though she felt not all the resentment she displayed, still
      thought it necessary to support it, as she was much provoked with the
      perpetual inconsistency of his behaviour, and deemed it wholly improper to
      suffer, without discouragement, occasional sallies of tenderness from one
      who, in his general conduct, behaved with the most scrupulous reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now arrived at the castle; but entering by a back way, came to a
      small and narrow passage which obstructed the entrance of the umbrella;
      Delvile once more, and almost involuntarily, offered to help her; but,
      letting down the spring, she coldly said she had no further use for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went forward to open a small gate which led by another long
      passage into the hall; but hearing the servants advance, he held it for an
      instant in his hand, while, in a tone of voice the most dejected, he said
      &ldquo;I am grieved to find you thus offended; but were it possible you could
      know half the wretchedness of my heart, the generosity of your own would
      make you regret this severity!&rdquo; and then, opening the gate, he bowed, and
      went another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was now in the midst of servants; but so much shocked and
      astonished by the unexpected speech of Delvile, which instantly changed
      all her anger into sorrow, that she scarce knew what they said to her, nor
      what she replied; though they all with one voice enquired what was become
      of Lady Honoria, and which way they should run to seek her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile then came also, and she was obliged to recollect herself. She
      immediately proposed her going to bed, and drinking white wine whey to
      prevent taking cold; cold, indeed, she feared not; yet she agreed to the
      proposal, for she was confounded and dismayed by what had passed, and
      utterly unable to hold any conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her perplexity and distress were, however, all attributed to fatigue and
      fright; and Mrs Delvile, having assisted in hurrying her to bed, went to
      perform the same office for Lady Honoria, who arrived at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left at length by herself, she revolved in her mind the adventure of the
      evening, and the whole behaviour of Delvile since first she was acquainted
      with him. That he loved her with tenderness, with fondness loved her,
      seemed no longer to admit of any doubt, for however distant and cold he
      appeared, when acting with circumspection and design, the moment he was
      off his guard from surprise, terror, accident of any sort, the moment that
      he was betrayed into acting from nature and inclination, he was constantly
      certain to discover a regard the most animated and flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      This regard, however, was not more evident than his desire to conceal and
      to conquer it; he seemed to dread even her sight, and to have imposed upon
      himself the most rigid forbearance of all conversation or intercourse with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence could this arise? what strange and unfathomable cause could render
      necessary a conduct so mysterious? he knew not, indeed, that she herself
      wished it changed, but he could not be ignorant that his chance with
      almost any woman would at least be worth trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the obstacle which thus discouraged him the condition imposed by her
      uncle's will of giving her own name to the man she married? this she
      herself thought was an unpleasant circumstance, but yet so common for an
      heiress, that it could hardly out-weigh the many advantages of such a
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta again occurred to her; the letter she had seen in her hands was
      still unexplained; yet her entire conviction that Henrietta was not loved
      by him, joined to a certainty that affection alone could ever make him
      think of her, lessened upon this subject her suspicions every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Euphrasia Pemberton, at last, rested most upon her mind, and she
      thought it probable some actual treaty was negociating with the Duke of
      Derwent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile she had every reason to believe was her friend, though she was
      scrupulously delicate in avoiding either raillery or observation upon the
      subject of her son, whom she rarely mentioned, and never but upon
      occasions in which Cecilia could have no possible interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father, therefore, notwithstanding all Mr Monckton had represented to
      the contrary, appeared to be the real obstacle; his pride might readily
      object to her birth, which though not contemptible, was merely decent, and
      which, if traced beyond her grandfather, lost all title even to that
      epithet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this, however,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is at last his situation, how much have I
      been to blame in censuring his conduct! for while to me he has appeared
      capricious, he has, in fact, acted wholly from necessity; if his father
      insists upon his forming another connection, has he not been honourable,
      prudent and just, in flying an object that made him think of disobedience,
      and endeavouring to keep her ignorant of a partiality it is his duty to
      curb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All, therefore, that remained for her to do or to resolve, was to guard
      her own secret with more assiduous care than ever, and since she found
      that their union was by himself thought impossible, to keep from his
      knowledge that the regret was not all his own.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER vi. &mdash; A MYSTERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For two days, in consequence of violent colds caught during the storm,
      Lady Honoria Pemberton and Cecilia were confined to their rooms. Cecilia,
      glad by solitude and reflection to compose her spirits and settle her plan
      of conduct, would willingly have still prolonged her retirement, but the
      abatement of her cold affording her no pretence, she was obliged on the
      third day to make her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria, though less recovered, as she had been more a sufferer, was
      impatient of any restraint, and would take no denial to quitting her room
      at the same time; at dinner, therefore, all the family met at usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile, with his accustomed solemnity of civility, made various
      enquiries and congratulations upon their danger and their security,
      carefully in both, addressing himself first to Lady Honoria, and then with
      more stateliness in his kindness, to Cecilia. His lady, who had frequently
      visited them both, had nothing new to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile did not come in till they were all seated, when, hastily saying he
      was glad to see both the ladies so well again, he instantly employed
      himself in carving, with the agitation of a man who feared trusting
      himself to sit idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little, however, as he said, Cecilia was much struck by the melancholy
      tone of his voice, and the moment she raised her eyes, she observed that
      his countenance was equally sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortimer,&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile, &ldquo;I am sure you are not well; I cannot
      imagine why you will not have some advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I to send for a physician, Sir,&rdquo; cried Delvile, with affected
      chearfulness, &ldquo;he would find it much more difficult to imagine what advice
      to give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me however, Mr Mortimer,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;to return you my
      humble thanks for the honour of your assistance in the thunder storm! I am
      afraid you made yourself ill by attending <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship,&rdquo; returned Delvile, colouring very high, yet pretending to
      laugh; &ldquo;made so great a coward of me, that I ran away from shame at my own
      inferiority of courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you, then, with Lady Honoria during the storm?&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madam!&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria very quick; &ldquo;but he was so good as to <i>leave</i>
      me during the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortimer,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, &ldquo;is this possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lady Honoria was such a Heroine,&rdquo; answered Delvile, &ldquo;that she wholly
      disdained receiving any assistance; her valour was so much more undaunted
      than mine, that she ventured to brave the lightning under an oak tree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, dear Mrs Delvile,&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Honoria, &ldquo;think what a simpleton
      he would have made of me! he wanted to persuade me that in the open air I
      should be less exposed to danger than under the shelter of a thick tree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Honoria,&rdquo; replied Mrs Delvile, with a sarcastic smile, &ldquo;the next
      tale of scandal you oblige me to hear, I will insist for your punishment
      that you shall read one of Mr Newbury's little books! there are twenty of
      them that will explain this matter to you, and such reading will at least
      employ your time as usefully as such tales!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma'am,&rdquo; said Lady Honoria, &ldquo;I don't know whether you are laughing
      at me or not, but really I concluded Mr Mortimer only chose to amuse
      himself in a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Miss Beverley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not with Miss Beverley,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile with quickness; &ldquo;she
      was alone,&mdash;I saw her myself the moment she came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&mdash;but not then,-he was gone;&rdquo;&mdash;said Cecilia,
      endeavouring, but not very successfully, to speak with composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the honour,&rdquo; cried Delvile, making, with equal success, the same
      attempt, &ldquo;to wait upon Miss Beverley to the little gate; and I was then
      returning to Lady Honoria when I met her ladyship just coming in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very extraordinary, Mortimer,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, staring, &ldquo;to attend Lady
      Honoria the last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be angry in earnest, Sir,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, gaily, &ldquo;for I did
      not mean to turn tell-tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the subject was dropt; greatly to the joy both of Delvile and
      Cecilia, who mutually exerted themselves in talking upon what next was
      started, in order to prevent its being recurred to again.
    </p>
    <p>
      That fear, however, over, Delvile said little more; sadness hung heavily
      on his mind; he was absent, disturbed, uneasy; yet he endeavoured no
      longer to avoid Cecilia; on the contrary, when she arose to quit the room,
      he looked evidently disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies' colds kept them at home all the evening, and Delvile, for the
      first time since their arrival at the castle, joined them at tea; nor when
      it was over, did he as usual retire; he loitered, pretended to be caught
      by a new pamphlet, and looked as anxiously eager to speak with Cecilia, as
      he had hitherto appeared to shun her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With new emotion and fresh distress Cecilia perceived this change; what he
      might have to say she could not conjecture, but all that foreran his
      communication convinced her it was nothing she could wish; and much as she
      had desired some explanation of his designs, when the long-expected moment
      seemed arriving, prognostications the most cruel of the event, repressed
      her impatience, and deadened her curiosity. She earnestly lamented her
      unfortunate residence in his house, where the adoration of every
      inhabitant, from his father to the lowest servant, had impressed her with
      the strongest belief of his general worthiness, and greatly, though
      imperceptibly, encreased her regard for him, since she had now not a doubt
      remaining but that some cruel, some fatal obstacle, prohibited their
      union.
    </p>
    <p>
      To collect fortitude to hear it with composure, was now her whole study;
      but though, when alone, she thought any discovery preferable to suspence,
      all her courage failed her when Delvile appeared, and if she could not
      detain Lady Honoria, she involuntarily followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed four or five days; during which the health of Delvile seemed
      to suffer with his mind, and though he refused to acknowledge he was ill,
      it was evident to every body that he was far from well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile frequently urged him to consent to have some advice; but he
      always revived, though with forced and transitory spirits, at the mention
      of a physician, and the proposal ended in nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, too, at length grew alarmed; her enquiries were more
      penetrating and pointed, but they were not more successful; every attack
      of this sort was followed by immediate gaiety, which, however constrained,
      served, for the time, to change the subject. Mrs Delvile, however, was not
      soon to be deceived; she watched her son incessantly, and seemed to feel
      an inquietude scarce less than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's distress was now augmented every moment, and the difficulty to
      conceal it grew every hour more painful; she felt herself the cause of the
      dejection of the son, and that thought made her feel guilty in the
      presence of the mother; the explanation she expected threatened her with
      new misery, and the courage to endure it she tried in vain to acquire; her
      heart was most cruelly oppressed, apprehension and suspence never left it
      for an instant; rest abandoned her at night, and chearfulness by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the two lords, Ernolf and Derford, arrived; and Cecilia, who
      at first had lamented their design, now rejoiced in their presence, since
      they divided the attention of Mrs Delvile, which she began to fear was not
      wholly directed to her son, and since they saved her from having the whole
      force of Lady Honoria's high spirits and gay rattle to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their immediate observations upon the ill looks of Delvile, startled both
      Cecilia and the mother even more than their own fears, which they had
      hoped were rather the result of apprehension than of reason. Cecilia now
      severely reproached herself with having deferred the conference he was
      evidently seeking, not doubting but she had contributed to his
      indisposition by denying him the relief he might expect from concluding
      the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melancholy as was this idea, it was yet a motive to overpower her
      reluctance, and determine her no longer to shun what it seemed necessary
      to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep reasoners, however, when they are also nice casuists, frequently
      resolve with a tardiness which renders their resolutions of no effect;
      this was the case with Cecilia; the same morning that she came down stairs
      prepared to meet with firmness the blow which she believed awaited her,
      Delvile, who, since the arrival of the two lords, had always appeared at
      the general breakfast, acknowledged in answer to his mother's earnest
      enquiries, that he had a cold and head-ache; and had he, at the same time,
      acknowledged a pleurisy and fever, the alarm instantly spread in the
      family could not have been greater; Mr Delvile, furiously ringing the
      bell, ordered a man and horse to go that moment to Dr Lyster, the
      physician to the family, and not to return without him if he was himself
      alive; and Mrs Delvile, not less distressed, though more quiet, fixed her
      eyes upon her son, with an expression of anxiety that shewed her whole
      happiness was bound in his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile endeavoured to laugh away their fears, assuring them he should be
      well the next day, and representing in ridiculous terms the perplexity of
      Dr Lyster to contrive some prescription for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's behaviour, guided by prudence and modesty, was steady and
      composed; she believed his illness and his uneasiness were the same, and
      she hoped the resolution she had taken would bring relief to them both
      while the terrors of Mr and Mrs Delvile seemed so greatly beyond the
      occasion, that her own were rather lessened than increased by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Lyster soon arrived; he was a humane and excellent physician, and a man
      of sound judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, gaily, shaking hands with him, said &ldquo;I believe, Dr Lyster, you
      little expected to meet a patient, who, were he as skilful, would be as
      able to do business as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, with such a hand as this?&rdquo; cried the Doctor; &ldquo;come, come, you must
      not teach me my own profession. When I attend a patient, I come to tell
      how he is myself, not to be told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, then ill!&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile; &ldquo;oh Mortimer, why have you thus
      deceived us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his disorder?&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile; &ldquo;let us call in more help; who
      shall we send for, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again he rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; said Dr Lyster, coolly; &ldquo;must a man be dying if he is not in
      perfect health? we want nobody else; I hope I can prescribe for a cold
      without demanding a consultation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure it is merely a cold?&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile; &ldquo;may not some
      dreadful malady&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Sir, have patience,&rdquo; interrupted the doctor; &ldquo;Mr Mortimer and I
      will have some discourse together presently; mean time, let us all sit
      down, and behave like Christians; I never talk of my art before company.
      'Tis hard you won't let me be a gentleman at large for two minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria and Cecilia would then have risen, but neither Dr Lyster nor
      Delvile would permit them to go; and a conversation tolerably lively took
      place, after which, the party in general separating, the doctor
      accompanied Delvile to his own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then went up stairs, where she most impatiently waited some
      intelligence; none, however, arriving, in about half an hour she returned
      to the parlour; she found it empty, but was soon joined by Lady Honoria
      and Lord Ernolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria, happy in having something going forward, and not much
      concerning herself whether it were good or evil, was as eager to
      communicate what she had gathered, as Cecilia was to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;so I don't find at last but that all this
      prodigious illness will be laid to your account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my account?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;how is that possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this tender chicken caught cold in the storm last week, and not being
      put to bed by its mama, and nursed with white-wine whey, the poor thing
      has got a fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine young man,&rdquo; said Lord Ernolf; &ldquo;I should be sorry any harm
      happened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>was</i> a fine young man, my lord,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;but he is
      grown intolerably stupid lately; however, it's all the fault of his father
      and mother. Was ever any thing half so ridiculous as their behaviour this
      morning? it was with the utmost difficulty I forbore laughing in their
      faces; and really, I believe if I was to meet with such an unfortunate
      accident with Mr Delvile, it would turn him to marble at once! indeed he
      is little better now, but such an affront as that would never let him move
      from the spot where he received it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive him, however,&rdquo; returned Lord Ernolf, &ldquo;for his anxiety about his
      son, since he is the last of so ancient a family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is his great misfortune, my lord,&rdquo; answered Lady Honoria, &ldquo;because
      it is the very reason they make such a puppet of him. If there were but a
      few more little masters to dandle and fondle, I'll answer for it this
      precious Mortimer would soon be left to himself; and then, really, I
      believe he would be a good tolerable sort of young man. Don't you think he
      would, Miss Beverley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes!&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;I believe&mdash;I think so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, I did not ask if you thought him tolerable <i>now</i>, so no
      need to be frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they were interrupted by the entrance of Dr Lyster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;and when am I to go into mourning for my
      cousin Mortimer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why very soon,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;unless you take better care of him. He has
      confessed to me that after being out in the storm last Wednesday, he sat
      in his wet cloaths all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;and what would that do to him? I have no
      notion of a man's always wanting a cambric handkerchief about his throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your ladyship had rather make him apply it to his eyes?&rdquo; cried
      the doctor; &ldquo;however, sitting inactive in wet cloaths would destroy a
      stouter man than Mr Delvile; but he <i>forgot</i> it, he says! which of
      you two young ladies could not have given as good reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your most obedient,&rdquo; said Lady Honoria, &ldquo;and why should not a lady give
      as good a reason as a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered he, drily, &ldquo;but from want of practice, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O worse and worse!&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria; &ldquo;you shall never be my physician;
      if I was to be attended by you, you'd make me sick instead of well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;for then I must have the honour of
      attending you till I made you well instead of sick.&rdquo; And with a
      good-humoured smile, he left them; and Lord Derford, at the same time,
      coming into the room, Cecilia contrived to stroll out into the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account to which she had been listening redoubled her uneasiness; she
      was conscious that whatever was the indisposition of Delvile, and whether
      it was mental or bodily, she was herself its occasion; through her he had
      been negligent, she had rendered him forgetful, and in consulting her own
      fears in preference to his peace, she had avoided an explanation, though
      he had vigilantly sought one. <i>She knew not</i>, he told her, <i>half
      the wretchedness of his heart</i>.&mdash;Alas! thought she, he little
      conjectures the state of mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria suffered her not to be long alone; in about half an hour she
      ran after her, gaily calling out, &ldquo;O Miss Beverley, you have lost the
      delightfullest diversion in the world! I have just had the most ridiculous
      scene with my Lord Derford that you ever heard in your life! I asked him
      what put it in his head to be in love with you,&mdash;and he had the
      simplicity to answer, quite seriously, his father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very right,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;if the desire of uniting two estates
      is to be denominated being in love; for that, most certainly, was put into
      his head by his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O but you have not heard half. I told him, then, that, as a friend, in
      confidence I must acquaint him, I believed you intended to marry Mortimer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, Lady Honoria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you shall hear the reason; because, as I assured him, it was proper he
      should immediately call him to account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Lady Honoria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you know, said I, Miss Beverley has had one duel fought for her
      already, and a lady who has once had that compliment paid her, always
      expects it from every new admirer; and I really believe your not observing
      that form is the true cause of her coldness to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible you can have talked so wildly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and what is much better, he believed every word I said!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better?&mdash;No, indeed, it is much worse! and if, in fact, he is
      so uncommonly weak, I shall really be but little indebted to your ladyship
      for giving him such notions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O I would not but have done it for the world! for I never laughed so
      immoderately in my life. He began assuring me he was not afraid, for he
      said he had practised fencing more than any thing; so I made him promise
      to send a challenge to Mortimer as soon as he is well enough to come down
      again; for Dr Lyster has ordered him to keep his room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, smothering her concern for this last piece of intelligence by
      pretending to feel it merely for the former, expostulated with Lady
      Honoria upon so mischievous a frolic, and earnestly entreated her to go
      back and contradict it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not for the world!&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;he has not the least spirit, and
      I dare say he would not fight to save the whole nation from destruction;
      but I'll make him believe that it's necessary, in order to give him
      something to think of, for really his poor head is so vacant, that I am
      sure if one might but play upon it with sticks, it would sound just like a
      drum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, finding it vain to combat with her fantasies, was at length
      obliged to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day she passed very unpleasantly; Delvile appeared not;
      his father was restless and disturbed, and his mother, though attentive to
      her guests, and, for their sakes rallying her spirits, was visibly ill
      disposed to think or to talk but of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      One diversion, however, Cecilia found for herself; Delvile had a favourite
      spaniel, which, when he walked followed him, and when he rode, ran by his
      horse; this dog, who was not admitted into the house, she now took under
      her own care; and spent almost the whole day out of doors, chiefly for the
      satisfaction of making him her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when Dr Lyster came again, she kept in the way, in order
      to hear his opinion; and was sitting with Lady Honoria in the parlour,
      when he entered it to write a prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, in a few moments, followed him, and with a face and voice of
      the tenderest maternal apprehensions, said &ldquo;Doctor, one thing entrust me
      with immediately; I can neither bear imposition nor suspense;&mdash;you
      know what I would say!&mdash;tell me if I have any thing to fear, that my
      preparations may be adequate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I believe, in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe!&rdquo; repeated Mrs Delvile, starting; &ldquo;Oh doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you would not have me say I am <i>certain</i>, would you? these are
      no times for Popery and infallibility; however, I assure you I think him
      perfectly safe. He has done a foolish and idle trick, but no man is wise
      always. We must get rid of his fever, and then if his cold remains, with
      any cough, he may make a little excursion to Bristol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Bristol! nay then,&mdash;I understand you too well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you don't understand me at all; I don't send him to Bristol
      because he is in a bad way, but merely because I mean to put him in a good
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him, then, go immediately; why should he increase the danger by
      waiting a moment? I will order&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, hold! I know what to order myself! 'Tis a strange thing people will
      always teach me my own duty! why should I make a man travel such weather
      as this in a fever? do you think I want to confine him in a mad-house, or
      be confined in one myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you know best&mdash;but still if there is any danger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, there is not! only we don't chuse there should be any. And how
      will he entertain himself better than by going to Bristol? I send him
      merely on a jaunt of pleasure; and I am sure he will be safer there than
      shut up in a house with two such young ladies as these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he made off. Mrs Delvile, too anxious for conversation, left the
      room, and Cecilia, too conscious for silence, forced herself into
      discourse with Lady Honoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days she passed in this uncertainty what she had to expect; blaming
      those fears which had deferred an explanation, and tormented by Lady
      Honoria, whose raillery and levity now grew very unseasonable. Fidel, the
      favourite spaniel, was almost her only consolation, and she pleased
      herself not inconsiderably by making a friend of the faithful animal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER vii. &mdash; AN ANECDOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the fourth day the house wore a better aspect; Delvile's fever was
      gone, and Dr Lyster permitted him to leave his room; a cough, however,
      remained, and his journey to Bristol was settled to take place in three
      days. Cecilia, knowing he was now expected down stairs, hastened out of
      the parlour the moment she had finished her breakfast; for affected by his
      illness, and hurt at the approaching separation, she dreaded the first
      meeting, and wished to fortify her mind for bearing it with propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a very few minutes, Lady Honoria, running after her, entreated that she
      would come down; &ldquo;for Mortimer,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is in the parlour, and the
      poor child is made so much of by its papa and mama, that I wish they don't
      half kill him by their ridiculous fondness. It is amazing to me he is so
      patient with them, for if they teized me half as much, I should be ready
      to jump up and shake them. But I wish you would come down, for I assure
      you it's a comical scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship is soon diverted! but what is there so comical in the
      anxiety of parents for an only son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, they don't care a straw for him all the time! it's merely that he
      may live to keep up this old castle, which I hope in my heart he will pull
      down the moment they are dead! But do pray come; it will really give you
      spirits to see them all. The father keeps ringing the bell to order half a
      hundred pair of boots for him, and all the greatcoats in the county; and
      the mother sits and looks as if a hearse and mourning coach were already
      coming over the drawbridge; but the most diverting object among them is my
      Lord Derford! O, it is really too entertaining to see him! there he sits,
      thinking the whole time of his challenge! I intend to employ him all this
      afternoon in practising to shoot at a mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then again she pressed her to join the group, and Cecilia, fearing her
      opposition might seem strange, consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile arose at her entrance, and, with tolerable steadiness, she
      congratulated him on his recovery; and then, taking her usual seat,
      employed herself in embroidering a screen. She joined too, occasionally,
      in the conversation, and observed, not without surprise, that Delvile
      seemed much less dejected than before his confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, he ordered his horse, and, accompanied by Lord Derford, rode
      out. Mr Delvile then took Lord Ernolf to shew him some intended
      improvements in another part of the castle, and Lady Honoria walked away
      in search of any entertainment she could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, in better spirits than she had been for many days, sent for
      her own work, and sitting by Cecilia, conversed with her again as in
      former times; mixing instruction with entertainment, and general satire
      with particular kindness, in a manner at once so lively and so flattering,
      that Cecilia herself reviving, found but little difficulty in bearing her
      part in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, with some gaiety, and tolerable ease, was spent the greatest
      part of the morning; but just as they were talking of changing their dress
      for dinner, Lady Honoria with an air of the utmost exultation, came flying
      into the room. &ldquo;Well, ma'am,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I have some news now that I <i>must</i>
      tell you, because it will make you believe me another time though I know
      it will put you in a passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's sweetly designed, at least!&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, laughing; &ldquo;however,
      I'll trust you, for my passions will not, just now, be irritated by
      straws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma'am, don't you remember I told you when you were in town that Mr
      Mortimer kept a mistress&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, disdainfully, &ldquo;and you may remember, Lady
      Honoria, I told you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you would not believe a word of it! but it's all true, I assure you!
      and now he has brought her down here; he sent for her about three weeks
      ago, and he has boarded her at a cottage, about half a mile from the
      Park-gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, to whom Henrietta Belfield was instantly present, changed colour
      repeatedly, and turned so extremely sick, she could with difficulty keep
      her seat. She forced herself, however, to continue her work, though she
      knew so little what she was about, that she put her needle in and out of
      the same place without ceasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs Delvile, with a countenance of the utmost indignation,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Lady Honoria, if you think a tale of scandal such as this
      reflects no disgrace upon its relater, you must pardon me for entreating
      you to find an auditor more of the same opinion than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, ma'am, since you are so angry, I'll tell you the whole affair, for
      this is but half of it. He has a child here, too,&mdash;I vow I long to
      see it!&mdash;and he is so fond of it that he spends half his time in
      nursing it;&mdash;and that, I suppose, is the thing that takes him out so
      much; and I fancy, too, that's what has made him grow so grave, for may be
      he thinks it would not be pretty to be very frisky, now he's a papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not only Cecilia, but Mrs Delvile herself was now overpowered, and she sat
      for some time wholly silent and confounded; Lady Honoria then, turning to
      Cecilia exclaimed, &ldquo;Bless me, Miss Beverley, what are you about! why that
      flower is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw! you have spoilt your whole
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, in the utmost confusion, though pretending to laugh, then began
      to unpick it; and Mrs Delvile, recovering, more calmly, though not less
      angrily, said &ldquo;And has this tale the honour of being invented solely by
      your ladyship, or had it any other assistant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, I assure you, it's no invention of mine; I had it from very good
      authority upon my word. But only look at Miss Beverley! would not one
      think I had said that she had a child herself? She looks as pale as death.
      My dear, I am sure you can't be well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, forcing a smile, though extremely
      provoked with her; &ldquo;I never was better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with the hope of appearing unconcerned, she raised her head; but
      meeting the eyes of Mrs Delvile fixed upon her face with a look of
      penetrating observation, abashed and guilty, she again dropt it, and
      resumed her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Honoria, &ldquo;I am sure there is no occasion to
      send for Dr Lyster to <i>you</i>, for you recover yourself in a moment;
      you have the finest colour now I ever saw; has not she, Mrs Delvile? did
      you ever see anybody blush so becomingly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, Lady Honoria,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, with severity, &ldquo;it were possible
      to see you blush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O but I never do! not but what it's pretty enough too; but I don't know
      how it is, it never happens. Now Euphrasia can blush from morning to
      night. I can't think how she contrives it. Miss Beverley, too, plays at it
      vastly well; she's red and white, and white and red half a dozen times in
      a minute. Especially,&rdquo; looking at her archly, and lowering her voice, &ldquo;if
      you talk to her of Mortimer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! no such thing!&rdquo; cried Cecilia with some resentment, and again
      looking up; but glancing her eyes towards Mrs Delvile, and again meeting
      hers, filled with the strongest expression of enquiring solicitude, unable
      to sustain their inquisition, and shocked to find herself thus watchfully
      observed, she returned in hasty confusion to her employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, again, &ldquo;but what are you about now?
      do you intend to unpick the whole screen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can she tell what she is doing,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, with quickness,
      &ldquo;if you torment her thus incessantly? I will take you away from her, that
      she may have a little peace. You shall do me the honour to attend my
      toilette, and acquaint me with some further particulars of this
      extraordinary discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile then left the room, but Lady Honoria, before she followed her,
      said in a low voice &ldquo;Pity me, Miss Beverley, if you have the least
      good-nature! I am now going to hear a lecture of two hours long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, left to herself was in a perturbation almost insupportable;
      Delvile's mysterious conduct seemed the result of some entanglement of
      vice; Henrietta Belfield, the artless Henrietta Belfield, she feared had
      been abused, and her own ill-fated partiality, which now more than ever
      she wished unknown even to herself, was evidently betrayed where most the
      dignity of her mind made her desire it to be concealed!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of shame, regret and resentment, which made her forget to
      change her dress, or her place, she was suddenly surprised by Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting and colouring, she busied herself with collecting her work, that
      she might hurry out of the room. Delvile, though silent himself,
      endeavoured to assist her; but when she would have gone, he attempted to
      stop her, saying &ldquo;Miss Beverley, for three minutes only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; cried she, indignantly, &ldquo;not for an instant!&rdquo; and leaving him
      utterly astonished, she hastened to her own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was then sorry she had been so precipitate; nothing had been clearly
      proved against him; no authority was so likely to be fallacious as that of
      Lady Honoria; neither was he under any engagement to herself that could
      give her any right to manifest such displeasure. These reflections,
      however, came too late, and the quick feelings of her agitated mind were
      too rapid to wait the dictates of cool reason. At dinner she attended
      wholly to Lord Ernolf, whose assiduous politeness, profiting by the
      humour, saved her the painful effort of forcing conversation, or the
      guilty consciousness of giving way to silence, and enabled her to preserve
      her general tenor between taciturnity and loquaciousness. Mrs Delvile she
      did not once dare look at; but her son, she saw, seemed greatly hurt; yet
      it was proudly, not sorrowfully, and therefore she saw it with less
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the rest of the day, which was passed in general society, Mrs
      Delvile, though much occupied, frequently leaving the room, and sending
      for Lady Honoria, was more soft, kind and gentle with Cecilia than ever,
      looking at her with the utmost tenderness, often taking her hand, and
      speaking to her with even unusual sweetness. Cecilia with mingled sadness
      and pleasure observed this encreasing regard, which she could not but
      attribute to the discovery made through Lady Honoria's mischievous
      intelligence, and which, while it rejoiced her with the belief of her
      approbation, added fresh force to her regret in considering it was
      fruitless. Delvile, mean-time, evidently offended himself, conversed only
      with the gentlemen, and went very early into his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were all retiring, Mrs Delvile, following Cecilia, dismissed her
      maid to talk with her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not, I hope, often,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;solicitous or importunate to speak
      about my son; his character, I believe, wants no vindication; clear and
      unsullied, it has always been its own support; yet the aspersion cast upon
      it this morning by Lady Honoria, I think myself bound to explain, not
      partially as his mother, but simply as his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who knew not whither such an explanation might lead, nor
      wherefore it was made, heard this opening with much emotion, but gave
      neither to that nor to what followed any interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile then continued; she had taken the trouble, she said, to sift
      the whole affair, in order to shame Lady Honoria by a pointed conviction
      of what she had invented, and to trace from the foundation the
      circumstances whence her surmises or report had sprung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, it seems, about a fortnight before the present time, in one of
      his morning walks, had observed a gipsey sitting by the side of the high
      road, who seemed extremely ill, and who had a very beautiful child tied to
      her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck with the baby, he stopt to enquire to whom it belonged; to herself,
      she said, and begged his charity with the most pitiable cries of distress;
      telling him that she was travelling to join some of her fraternity, who
      were in a body near Bath, but was so ill with an ague and fever that she
      feared she should die on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile desired her to go to the next cottage, and promised to pay for her
      board there till she was better. He then spoke to the man and his wife who
      owned it to take them in, who, glad to oblige his Honour, instantly
      consented, and he had since called twice to see in what manner they went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How simple,&rdquo; continued Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;is a matter of fact in itself, and
      how complex when embellished! This tale has been told by the cottagers to
      our servants; it has travelled, probably gaining something from every
      mouth, to Lady Honoria's maid, and, having reached her ladyship, was
      swelled in a moment into all we heard! I think, however, that, for some
      time at least, her levity will be rather less daring. I have not, in this
      affair, at all spared her; I made her hear from Mortimer himself the
      little story as it happened; I then carried her to the cottage, where we
      had the whole matter confirmed; and I afterwards insisted upon being told
      myself by her maid all she had related to her lady, that she might thus be
      unanswerably convicted of inventing whatever she omitted. I have
      occasioned her some confusion, and, for the moment, a little resentment;
      but she is so volatile that neither will last; and though, with regard to
      my own family, I may perhaps have rendered her more cautious, I fear, with
      regard to the world in general, she is utterly incorrigible, because it
      has neither pleasure nor advantage to offer, that can compensate for the
      deprivation of relating one staring story, or ridiculous anecdote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, wishing her good night, she added, &ldquo;I make not any apology for
      this detail, which you owe, not, believe me, to a mother's folly, but, if
      I [know] myself at all, to a love of truth and justice. Mortimer,
      independent of all connection with me, cannot but to every body appear of
      a character which may be deemed even exemplary; calumny, therefore,
      falling upon such a subject, injures not only himself but society, since
      it weakens all confidence in virtue, and strengthens the scepticism of
      depravity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Cecilia, &ldquo;to me, at least, this solicitude for his fame
      needs no apology! humane and generous Delvile! never, again, will I a
      moment doubt your worthiness!&rdquo; And then, cherishing that darling idea, she
      forgot all her cares and apprehensions, her quarrel, her suspicions, and
      the approaching separation, and, recompensed for every thing by this
      refutation of his guilt, she hastened to bed, and composed herself to
      rest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER viii. &mdash; A CONFERENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Cecilia had a visit from Lady Honoria, who came to
      tell her story her own way, and laugh at the anxiety of Mrs Delvile, and
      the trouble she had taken; &ldquo;for, after all,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;what did the
      whole matter signify? and how could I possibly help the mistake? when I
      heard of his paying for a woman's board, what was so natural as to suppose
      she must be his mistress? especially as there was a child in the case. O
      how I wish you had been with us! you never saw such a ridiculous sight in
      your life; away we went in the chaise full drive to the cottage,
      frightening all the people almost into fits; out came the poor woman, away
      ran the poor man,&mdash;both of them thought the end of the world at hand!
      The gipsey was best off, for she went to her old business, and began
      begging. I assure you, I believe she would be very pretty if she was not
      so ill, and so I dare say Mortimer thought too, or I fancy he would not
      have taken such care of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, fie, Lady Honoria! will nothing bring conviction to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, you know, there's no harm in that, for why should not pretty people
      live as well as ugly ones? There's no occasion to leave nothing in the
      world but frights. I looked hard at the baby, to see if it was like
      Mortimer, but I could not make it out; those young things are like
      nothing. I tried if it would talk, for I wanted sadly to make it call Mrs
      Delvile grandmama; however, the little urchin could say nothing to be
      understood. O what a rage would Mrs Delvile have been in! I suppose this
      whole castle would hardly have been thought heavy enough to crush such an
      insolent brat, though it were to have fallen upon it all at a blow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus rattled this light-hearted lady till the family was assembled to
      breakfast; and then Cecilia, softened towards Delvile by newly-excited
      admiration, as well as by the absence which would separate them the
      following day, intended, by every little courteous office in her power, to
      make her peace with him before his departure; but she observed, with much
      chagrin, that Mrs Delvile never ceased to watch her, which, added to an
      air of pride in the coldness of Delvile, that he had never before assumed,
      discouraged her from making the attempt, and compelled her to seem quiet
      and unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as breakfast was over, the gentlemen all rode or walked out; and
      when the ladies were by themselves, Lady Honoria suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;Mrs
      Delvile, I can't imagine for what reason you send Mr Mortimer to Bristol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a reason, Lady Honoria, that with all your wildness, I should be very
      sorry you should know better by experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, ma'am; had we not better make a party, and all go? Miss
      Beverley, should you like to join it? I am afraid it would be vastly
      disagreeable to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, now again was <i>red and white, and white and red a dozen times
      in a minute</i>; and Mrs Delvile, rising and taking her hand, expressively
      said, &ldquo;Miss Beverley, you have a thousand times too much sensibility for
      this mad-cap of a companion. I believe I shall punish her by taking you
      away from her all this morning; will you come and sit with me in the
      dressing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia assented without daring to look at her, and followed in trembling,
      up stairs. Something of importance, she fancied, would ensue, her secret
      she saw was revealed, and therefore she could form no conjecture but that
      Delvile would be the subject of their discourse yet whether to explain his
      behaviour, or plead his cause, whether to express her separate
      approbation, or communicate some intelligence from himself, she had
      neither time, opportunity nor clue to unravel. All that was undoubted
      seemed the affection of Mrs Delvile, all that, on her own part, could be
      resolved, was to suppress her partiality till she knew if it might
      properly be avowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, who saw her perturbation, led immediately to subjects of
      indifference, and talked upon them so long, and with so much ease, that
      Cecilia, recovering her composure, began to think she had been mistaken,
      and that nothing was intended but a tranquil conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, however, as she had quieted her apprehensions, she sat silent
      herself, with a look that Cecilia easily construed into thoughtful
      perplexity in what manner she should introduce what she meant to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pause was succeeded by her speaking of Lady Honoria; &ldquo;how wild, how
      careless, how incorrigible she is! she lost her mother early; and the
      Duke, who idolizes her, and who, marrying very late, is already an old
      man, she rules entirely; with him, and a supple governess, who has neither
      courage to oppose her, nor heart to wish well but to her own interest, she
      has lived almost wholly. Lately, indeed, she has come more into the world,
      but without even a desire of improvement, and with no view and no thought
      but to gratify her idle humour by laughing at whatever goes forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly neither wants parts nor discernment,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;and,
      when my mind is not occupied by other matters, I find her conversation
      entertaining and agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;but that light sort of wit which attacks, with
      equal alacrity, what is serious or what is gay, is twenty times offensive,
      to once that it is exhilarating; since it shews that while its only aim is
      self-diversion, it has the most insolent negligence with respect to any
      pain it gives to others. The rank of Lady Honoria, though it has not
      rendered her proud, nor even made her conscious she has any dignity to
      support, has yet given her a saucy indifference whom she pleases or hurts,
      that borders upon what in a woman is of all things the most odious, a
      daring defiance of the world and its opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, never less disposed to enter upon her defence, made but little
      answer; and, soon after, Mrs Delvile added, &ldquo;I heartily wish she were
      properly established; and yet, according to the pernicious manners and
      maxims of the present age, she is perhaps more secure from misconduct
      while single, than she will be when married. Her father, I fear, will
      leave her too much to herself, and in that case I scarce know what may
      become of her; she has neither judgment nor principle to direct her
      choice, and therefore, in all probability, the same whim which one day
      will guide it, will the next lead her to repent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they were both silent; and then Mrs Delvile, gravely, yet with
      energy exclaimed, &ldquo;How few are there, how very few, who marry at once upon
      principles rational, and feelings pleasant! interest and inclination are
      eternally at strife, and where either is wholly sacrificed, the other is
      inadequate to happiness. Yet how rarely do they divide the attention! the
      young are rash, and the aged are mercenary; their deliberations are never
      in concert, their views are scarce ever blended; one vanquishes, and the
      other submits; neither party temporizes, and commonly each is unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is now arrived when reflections of this sort
      cannot too seriously occupy me; the errors I have observed in others, I
      would fain avoid committing; yet such is the blindness of self-love, that
      perhaps, even at the moment I censure them, I am falling, without
      consciousness, into the same! nothing, however, shall through negligence
      be wrong; for where is the son who merits care and attention, if Mortimer
      from his parents deserves not to meet them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expectations of Cecilia were now again awakened, and awakened with
      fresh terrors lest Mrs Delvile, from compassion, meant to offer her
      services; vigorously, therefore, she determined to exert herself, and
      rather give up Mortimer and all thoughts of him for ever, than submit to
      receive assistance in persuading him to the union.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Delvile,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is most earnest and impatient that some
      alliance should take place without further delay; and for myself, could I
      see him with propriety and with happiness disposed of, what a weight of
      anxiety would be removed from my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now made an effort to speak, attempting to say &ldquo;Certainly, it is a
      matter of great consequence;&rdquo; but so low was her voice, and so confused
      her manner, that Mrs Delvile, though attentively listening, heard not a
      word. She forbore, however, to make her repeat what she said, and went on
      herself as if speaking in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only his own, but the peace of his whole family will depend upon his
      election, since he is the last of his race. This castle and estate, and
      another in the north, were entailed upon him by the late Lord Delvile, his
      grandfather, who, disobliged by his eldest son, the present lord, left
      every thing he had power to dispose of to his second son, Mr Delvile, and
      at his death, to his grandson, Mortimer. And even the present lord, though
      always at variance with his brother, is fond of his nephew, and has
      declared him his heir. I, also, have one sister, who is rich, who has no
      children, and who has made the same declaration. Yet though with such high
      expectations, he must not connect himself imprudently; for his paternal
      estate wants repair, and he is well entitled with a wife to expect what it
      requires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most true! thought Cecilia, yet ashamed of her recent failure, she applied
      herself to her work, and would not again try to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is amiable, accomplished, well educated, and well born; far may we
      look, and not meet with his equal; no woman need disdain, and few women
      would refuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia blushed her concurrence; yet could well at that moment have spared
      hearing the eulogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet how difficult,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to find a proper alliance! there are
      many who have some recommendations, but who is there wholly
      unexceptionable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question seemed unanswerable; nor could Cecilia devise what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls of high family have but seldom large fortunes, since the heads of
      their house commonly require their whole wealth for the support of their
      own dignity; while on the other hand, girls of large fortune are
      frequently ignorant, insolent, or low born; kept up by their friends lest
      they should fall a prey to adventurers, they have no acquaintance with the
      world, and little enlargement from education; their instructions are
      limited to a few merely youthful accomplishments; the first notion they
      imbibe is of their own importance, the first lesson they are taught is the
      value of riches, and even from their cradles, their little minds are
      narrowed, and their self-sufficiency is excited, by cautions to beware of
      fortune-hunters, and assurances that the whole world will be at their
      feet. Among such should we seek a companion for Mortimer? surely not.
      Formed for domestic happiness, and delighting in elegant society, his mind
      would disdain an alliance in which its affections had no share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia colouring and trembling, thought now the moment of her trial was
      approaching, and half mortified and half frightened prepared herself to
      sustain it with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I venture, therefore, my dear Miss Beverley, to speak to you upon this
      subject as a friend who will have patience to hear my perplexities; you
      see upon what they hang,&mdash;where the birth is such as Mortimer Delvile
      may claim, the fortune generally fails; and where the fortune is adequate
      to his expectations, the birth yet more frequently would disgrace us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, astonished by this speech, and quite off her guard from momentary
      surprize, involuntarily raised her head to look at Mrs Delvile, in whose
      countenance she observed the most anxious concern, though her manner of
      speaking had seemed placid and composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she continued, without appearing to remark the emotion of her
      auditor, &ldquo;Mr Delvile thought of uniting him with his cousin Lady Honoria;
      but he never could endure the proposal; and who shall blame his
      repugnance? her sister, indeed, Lady Euphrasia, is much preferable, her
      education has been better, and her fortune is much more considerable. At
      present, however, Mortimer seems greatly averse to her, and who has a
      right to be difficult, if we deny it to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wonder, uncertainty, expectation and suspence now all attacked Cecilia,
      and all harassed her with redoubled violence; why she was called to this
      conference she knew not; the approbation she had thought so certain, she
      doubted, and the proposal of assistance she had apprehended, she ceased to
      think would be offered some fearful mystery, some cruel obscurity, still
      clouded all her prospects, and not merely obstructed her view of the
      future, but made what was immediately before her gloomy and indistinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of her mind seemed read by Mrs Delvile, who examined her with
      eyes of such penetrating keenness, that they rather made discoveries than
      enquiries. She was silent some time, and looked irresolute how to proceed;
      but at length, she arose, and taking Cecilia by the hand, who almost drew
      it back from her dread of what would follow, she said &ldquo;I will torment you
      no more, my sweet young friend, with perplexities which you cannot
      relieve; this only I will say, and then drop the subject for ever; when my
      solicitude for Mortimer is removed, and he is established to the
      satisfaction of us all, no care will remain in the heart of his mother,
      half so fervent, so anxious and so sincere as the disposal of my amiable
      Cecilia, for whose welfare and happiness my wishes are even maternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then kissed her glowing cheek, and perceiving her almost stupified
      with astonishment, spared her any effort to speak, by hastily leaving her
      in possession of her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeceived in her expectations and chilled in her hopes, the heart of
      Cecilia no longer struggled to sustain its dignity, or conceal its
      tenderness; the conflict was at an end, Mrs Delvile had been open, though
      her son was mysterious; but, in removing her doubts, she had bereft her of
      her peace. She now found her own mistake in building upon her approbation;
      she saw nothing was less in her intentions, and that even when most ardent
      in affectionate regard, she separated her interest from that of her son as
      if their union was a matter of utter impossibility. &ldquo;Yet why,&rdquo; cried
      Cecilia, &ldquo;oh why is it deemed so! that she loves me, she is ever eager to
      proclaim, that my fortune would be, peculiarly useful, she makes not a
      secret, and that I, at least, should start no insuperable objections, she
      has, alas! but too obviously discovered! Has she doubts of her son?&mdash;no,
      she has too much discernment; the father, then, the haughty, impracticable
      father, has destined him for some woman of rank, and will listen to no
      other alliance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This notion somewhat soothed her in the disappointment she suffered; yet
      to know herself betrayed to Mrs Delvile, and to see no other consequence
      ensue but that of exciting a tender compassion, which led her to
      discourage, from benevolence, hopes too high to be indulged, was a
      mortification so severe, that it caused her a deeper depression of spirits
      than any occurrence of her life had yet occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Henrietta Belfield is to me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am to Mrs Delvile! but
      what in her is amiable and artless, in me is disgraceful and unworthy. And
      this is the situation which so long I have desired! This is the change of
      habitation which I thought would make me so happy! oh who can chuse, who
      can judge for himself? who can point out the road to his own felicity, or
      decide upon the spot where his peace will be ensured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, she had something to do, some spirit to exert, and some
      fortitude to manifest; Mortimer, she was certain, suspected not his own
      power; his mother, she knew, was both too good and too wise to reveal it
      to him, and she determined, by caution and firmness upon his leave-taking
      and departure, to retrieve, if possible, that credit with Mrs Delvile,
      which she feared her betrayed susceptibility had weakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, therefore, as she recovered from her consternation, she quitted
      Mrs Delvile's apartment, and seeking Lady Honoria herself, determined not
      to spend even a moment alone, till Mortimer was gone; lest the sadness of
      her reflections should overpower her resolution, and give a melancholy to
      her air and manner which he might attribute, with but too much justice, to
      concern upon his own account.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ix. &mdash; AN ATTACK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At dinner, with the assistance of Lord Ernolf, who was most happy to give
      it, Cecilia seemed tolerably easy. Lord Derford, too, encouraged by his
      father, endeavoured to engage some share of her attention; but he totally
      failed; her mind was superior to little arts of coquetry, and her pride
      had too much dignity to evaporate in pique; she determined, therefore, at
      this time, as at all others, to be consistent in shewing him he had no
      chance of her favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At tea, when they were again assembled, Mortimer's journey was the only
      subject of discourse, and it was agreed that he should set out very early
      in the morning, and, as the weather was extremely hot, not travel at all
      in the middle of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria then, in a whisper to Cecilia, said, &ldquo;I suppose, Miss
      Beverley, you will rise with the lark to-morrow morning? for your health,
      I mean. Early rising, you know, is vastly good for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, affecting not to understand her, said she should rise, she
      supposed, at her usual time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell Mortimer, however,&rdquo; returned her ladyship, &ldquo;to look up at your
      window before he goes off; for if he will play Romeo, you, I dare say,
      will play Juliet, and this old castle is quite the thing for the musty
      family of the Capulets; I dare say Shakespeare thought of it when he wrote
      of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to him what you please for yourself,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;but let me
      entreat you to say nothing for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my Lord Derford,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;will make an excessive pretty
      Paris, for he is vastly in love, though he has got nothing to say; but
      what shall we do for a Mercutio? we may find five hundred whining Romeos
      to one gay and charming Mercutio. Besides, Mrs Delvile, to do her justice,
      is really too good for the old Nurse, though Mr Delvile himself may serve
      for all the Capulets and all the Montagues at once, for he has pride
      enough for both their houses, and twenty more besides. By the way, if I
      don't take care, I shall have this Romeo run away before I have made my
      little dainty country Paris pick a quarrel with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then walked up to one of the windows, and motioning Lord Derford to
      follow her, Cecilia heard her say to him, &ldquo;Well, my lord, have you writ
      your letter? and have you sent it? Miss Beverley, I assure you, will be
      charmed beyond measure by such a piece of gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; answered the simple young lord, &ldquo;I have not sent it yet, for
      I have only writ a foul copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my lord,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;that is the very thing you ought to send! a foul
      copy of a challenge is always better than a fair one, for it looks written
      with more agitation. I am vastly glad you mentioned that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then, rising and joining them, said, &ldquo;What mischief is Lady
      Honoria about now? we must all be upon our guards, my lord, for she has a
      spirit of diversion that will not spare us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray why do you interfere?&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, and then, in a lower
      voice, she added, &ldquo;what do you apprehend? do you suppose Mortimer cannot
      manage such a poor little ideot as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose any thing about the matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, don't interrupt my operations. Lord Derford, Miss Beverley
      has been whispering me, that if you put this scheme in execution, she
      shall find you, ever after, irresistible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Derford, I hope,&rdquo; said Cecilia, laughing, &ldquo;is too well acquainted
      with your ladyship to be in any danger of credulity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vastly well!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I see you are determined to provoke me, so if
      you spoil my schemes, I will spoil yours, and tell a certain gentleman
      your tender terrors for his safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now, extremely alarmed, most earnestly entreated her to be quiet;
      but the discovery of her fright only excited her ladyship's laughter, and,
      with a look the most mischievously wicked, she called out &ldquo;Pray Mr
      Mortimer, come hither!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer instantly obeyed; and Cecilia at the same moment would with
      pleasure have endured almost any punishment to have been twenty miles off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something,&rdquo; continued her ladyship, &ldquo;of the utmost consequence to
      communicate to you. We have been settling an admirable plan for you; will
      you promise to be guided by us if I tell it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O certainly!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;to doubt that would disgrace us all round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&mdash;Miss Beverley, have you any objection to my
      proceeding?&rdquo; &ldquo;None at all!&rdquo; answered Cecilia, who had the understanding to
      know that the greatest excitement to ridicule is opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I must tell you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;it is the advice of us all,
      that as soon as you come to the possession of your estate, you make some
      capital alterations in this antient castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, greatly relieved, could with gratitude have embraced her; and
      Mortimer, very certain that such rattle was all her own, promised the
      utmost submission to her orders, and begged her further directions,
      declaring that he could not, at least, desire a fairer architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we mean,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;may be effected with the utmost ease; it is
      only to take out these old windows, and fix some thick iron grates in
      their place, and so turn the castle into a gaol for the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer laughed heartily at this proposition; but his father,
      unfortunately hearing it, sternly advanced, and with great austerity said,
      &ldquo;If I thought my son capable of putting such an insult upon his ancestors,
      whatever may be the value I feel for him, I would banish him my presence
      for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;how would his ancestors ever know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&mdash;why&mdash;that is a very extraordinary question, Lady
      Honoria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Sir, I dare say the sheriff, or the mayor and corporation, or
      some of those sort of people, would give him money enough, for the use of
      it, to run him up a mighty pretty neat little box somewhere near
      Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A box!&rdquo; exclaimed he indignantly; &ldquo;a neat little box for the heir of an
      estate such as this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only mean,&rdquo; cried she, giddily, &ldquo;that he might have some place a little
      more pleasant to live in, for really that old moat and draw-bridge are
      enough to vapour him to death; I cannot for my life imagine any use they
      are of; unless, indeed, to frighten away the deer, for nothing else offer
      to come over. But, if you were to turn the house into a gaol&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gaol?&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile, still more angrily, &ldquo;your ladyship must pardon
      me if I entreat you not to mention that word again when you are pleased to
      speak of Delvile Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is a term that, in itself, from a young lady, has a sound
      peculiarly improper; and which, applied to any gentleman's antient family
      seat,&mdash;a thing, Lady Honoria, always respectable, however lightly
      spoken of!&mdash;has an effect the least agreeable that can be devised;
      for it implies an idea either that the family, or the mansion, is going
      into decay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir, you know, with regard to the mansion, it is certainly very
      true, for all that other side, by the old tower, looks as if it would fall
      upon one's head every time one is forced to pass it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest, Lady Honoria,&rdquo; said Mr Delvile, &ldquo;that old tower, of which you
      are pleased to speak so slightingly, is the most honourable testimony to
      the antiquity of the castle of any now remaining, and I would not part
      with it for all the new boxes, as you style them, in the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I am very glad of it, Sir, for I dare say nobody would give
      even one of them for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Lady Honoria, you are greatly mistaken; they would give a
      thousand; such a thing, belonging to a man from his own ancestors, is
      invaluable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear Sir, what in the world could they do with it? unless, indeed,
      they were to let some man paint it for an opera scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthy use indeed!&rdquo; cried Mr Delvile, more and more affronted; &ldquo;and
      pray does your ladyship talk thus to my Lord Duke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes; and he never minds it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were strange if he did!&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile; &ldquo;my only astonishment is
      that anybody can be found who <i>does</i> mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why now, Mrs Delvile,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;pray be sincere; can you possibly
      think this Gothic ugly old place at all comparable to any of the new
      villas about town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gothic ugly old place!&rdquo; repeated Mr Delvile, in utter amazement at her
      dauntless flightiness; &ldquo;your ladyship really does my humble dwelling too
      much honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, I beg a thousand pardons!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I really did not think of
      what I was saying. Come, dear Miss Beverley, and walk out with me, for I
      am too much shocked to stay a moment longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, taking Cecilia by the arm, she hurried her into the park,
      through a door which led thither from the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake, Lady Honoria,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;could you find no better
      entertainment for Mr Delvile than ridiculing his own house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried she, laughing, &ldquo;did you never hear us quarrel before? why when
      I was here last summer, I used to affront him ten times a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was that a regular ceremony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really, I did not do it purposely; but it so happened; either by
      talking of the castle, or the tower, or the draw-bridge, or the
      fortifications; or wishing they were all employed to fill up that odious
      moat; or something of that sort; for you know a small matter will put him
      out of humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you call it so small a matter to wish a man's whole habitation
      annihilated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, I don't wish anything about it! I only say so to provoke him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what strange pleasure can that give you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O the greatest in the world! I take much delight in seeing anybody in a
      passion. It makes them look so excessively ugly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that the way you like every body should look, Lady Honoria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my dear, if you mean <i>me</i>, I never was in a passion twice in my
      life; for as soon as ever I have provoked the people, I always run away.
      But sometimes I am in a dreadful fright lest they should see me laugh, for
      they make such horrid grimaces it is hardly possible to look at them. When
      my father has been angry with me, I have sometimes been obliged to pretend
      I was crying, by way of excuse for putting my handkerchief to my face; for
      really he looks so excessively hideous, you would suppose he was making
      mouths, like the children, merely to frighten one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, &ldquo;your ladyship can, indeed, never want
      diversion, to find it in the anger of your father. But does it give you no
      other sensation? are you not afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O never! O what can he do to me, you know? he can only storm a little,
      and swear a little, for he always swears when he is angry; and perhaps
      order me to my own room; and ten to one but that happens to be the very
      thing I want; for we never quarrel but when we are alone, and then it's so
      dull, I am always wishing to run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you take no other method of leaving him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I think none so easily; and it can do him no harm, you know; I often
      tell him, when we make friends, that if it were not for a postilion and
      his daughter, he would be quite out of practice in scolding and swearing;
      for whenever he is upon the road he does nothing else; though why he is in
      such a hurry, nobody can divine, for go whither he will he has nothing to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus ran on this flighty lady, happy in high animal spirits, and careless
      who was otherwise, till, at some distance, they perceived Lord Derford,
      who was approaching to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;here comes your adorer; I shall therefore
      only walk on till we arrive at that large oak, and then make him prostrate
      himself at your feet, and leave you together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship is extremely good! but I am glad to be apprized of your
      intention, as it will enable me to save you that trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then turned quick back, and passing Lord Derford, who still walked on
      towards Lady Honoria, she returned to the house; but, upon entering the
      parlour, found all the company dispersed, Delvile alone excepted, who was
      walking about the room, with his tablets in his hand, in which he had been
      writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a mixture of shame and surprize, Cecilia, at the sight of him, was
      involuntarily retreating; but, hastening to the door, he called out in a
      reproachful tone, &ldquo;Will you not even enter the same room with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; cried she, returning; &ldquo;I was only afraid I disturbed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; answered he, gravely; &ldquo;you are the only person who could <i>not</i>
      disturb me, since my employment was making memorandums for a letter to
      yourself; with which, however, I did not desire to importune you, but that
      you have denied me the honour of even a five minutes' audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, in the utmost confusion at this attack, knew not whether to stand
      still or proceed; but, as he presently continued his speech, she found she
      had no choice but to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry to quit this place, especially as the length of my
      absence is extremely uncertain, while I have the unhappiness to be under
      your displeasure, without making some little attempt to apologize for the
      behaviour which incurred it. Must I, then, finish my letter, or will you
      at last deign to hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My displeasure, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;died with its occasion; I beg,
      therefore, that it may rest no longer in your remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant not, madam, to infer, that the subject or indeed that the object
      merited your deliberate attention; I simply wish to explain what may have
      appeared mysterious in my conduct, and for what may have seemed still more
      censurable, to beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now, recovered from her first apprehensions, and calmed, because
      piqued, by the calmness with which he spoke himself, made no opposition to
      his request, but suffering him to shut both the door leading into the
      garden, and that which led into the hall, she seated herself at one of the
      windows, determined to listen with intrepidity to this long expected
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations, however, which he made to obviate being overheard, added
      to the steadiness with which Cecilia waited his further proceedings, soon
      robbed him of the courage with which he began the assault, and evidently
      gave him a wish of retreating himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after much hesitation, he said &ldquo;This indulgence, madam,
      deserves my most grateful acknowledgments; it is, indeed, what I had
      little right, and still less reason, after the severity I have met with
      from you, to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here, at the very mention of severity, his courage, called upon by his
      pride, instantly returned, and he went on with the same spirit he had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That severity, however, I mean not to lament; on the contrary, in a
      situation such as mine, it was perhaps the first blessing I could receive;
      I have found from it, indeed, more advantage and relief than from all that
      philosophy, reflection or fortitude could offer. It has shewn me the
      vanity of bewailing the barrier, placed by fate to my wishes, since it has
      shewn me that another, less inevitable, but equally insuperable, would
      have opposed them. I have determined, therefore, after a struggle I must
      confess the most painful, to deny myself the dangerous solace of your
      society, and endeavour, by joining dissipation to reason, to forget the
      too great pleasure which hitherto it has afforded me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;will be your task; I can only wish the
      re-establishment of your health may be found no more difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; cried he, with a reproachful smile, &ldquo;<i>he jests at scars who
      never felt a wound!</i>&mdash;but this is a strain in which I have no
      right to talk, and I will neither offend your delicacy, nor my own
      integrity, by endeavouring to work upon the generosity of your disposition
      in order to excite your compassion. Not such was the motive with which I
      begged this audience; but merely a desire, before I tear myself away, to
      open to you my heart, without palliation or reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a few moments; and Cecilia finding her suspicions just that this
      interview was meant to be final, considered that her trial, however
      severe, would be short, and called forth all her resolution to sustain it
      with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;your
      character and your accomplishments were known to me; Mr Biddulph of
      Suffolk, who was my first friend at Oxford, and with whom my intimacy is
      still undiminished, was early sensible of your excellencies; we
      corresponded, and his letters were filled with your praises. He confessed
      to me, that his admiration had been unfortunate;&mdash;alas! I might now
      make the same confession to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Biddulph, among many of the neighbouring gentlemen, had made proposals
      to the Dean for Cecilia, which, at her desire, were rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mr Harrel saw masks in Portman-square, my curiosity to behold a lady
      so adored, and so cruel, led me thither; your dress made you easily
      distinguished.&mdash;Ah Miss Beverley! I venture not to mention what I
      then felt for my friend! I will only say that something which I felt for
      myself, warned me instantly to avoid you, since the clause in your uncle's
      will was already well known to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, then, at last, thought Cecilia, all perplexity is over!&mdash;the
      change of name is the obstacle; he inherits all the pride of his family,&mdash;and
      therefore to that family will I unrepining leave him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This warning,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I should not have disregarded, had I not,
      at the Opera, been deceived into a belief you were engaged; I then wished
      no longer to shun you; bound in honour to forbear all efforts at
      supplanting a man, to whom I thought you almost united, I considered you
      already as married, and eagerly as I sought your society, I sought it not
      with more pleasure than innocence. Yet even then, to be candid, I found in
      myself a restlessness about your affairs that kept me in eternal
      perturbation; but I flattered myself it was mere curiosity, and only
      excited by the perpetual change of opinion to which occasion gave rise,
      concerning which was the happy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Cecilia, coolly, &ldquo;there was any such mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not, madam, fatigue you,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;by tracing the progress of
      my unfortunate admiration; will endeavour to be more brief, for I see you
      are already wearied.&rdquo; He stopt a moment, hoping for some little
      encouragement; but Cecilia, in no humour to give it, assumed an air of
      unconcern, and sat wholly quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew not,&rdquo; he then went on, with a look of extreme mortification, &ldquo;the
      warmth with which I honoured your virtues, till you deigned to plead to me
      for Mr Belfield,&mdash;but let me not recollect the feelings of that
      moment!&mdash;yet were they nothing,&mdash;cold, languid, lifeless to what
      I afterwards experienced, when you undeceived me finally with respect to
      your situation, and informed me the report concerning Sir Robert Floyer
      was equally erroneous with that which concerned Belfield! O what was the
      agitation of my whole soul at that instant!&mdash;to know you disengaged,&mdash;to
      see you before me,&mdash;by the disorder of my whole frame to discover the
      mistake I had cherished&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then, half rising, yet again seating herself, looked extremely
      impatient to be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madam,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I will have done, and trace my feelings and
      my sufferings no longer, but hasten, for my own sake as well as yours, to
      the reason why I have spoken at all. From the hour that my ill-destined
      passion was fully known to myself, I weighed all the consequences of
      indulging it, and found, added to the extreme hazard of success, an
      impropriety even in the attempt. My honour in the honour of my family is
      bound; what to that would seem wrong, in me would be unjustifiable; yet
      where inducements so numerous were opposed by one single objection!&mdash;where
      virtue, beauty, education and family were all unexceptionable,&mdash;Oh
      cruel clause! barbarous and repulsive clause! that forbids my aspiring to
      the first of women, but by an action that with my own family would degrade
      me for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopt, overpowered by his own emotion, and Cecilia arose. &ldquo;I see,
      madam,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;your eagerness to be gone, and however at this moment I
      may lament it, I shall recollect it hereafter with advantage. But to
      conclude; I determined to avoid you, and, by avoiding, to endeavour to
      forget you; I determined, also, that no human being, and yourself least of
      all, should know, should even suspect the situation of my mind; and though
      upon various occasions, my prudence and forbearance have suddenly yielded
      to surprise and to passion, the surrender has been short, and almost, I
      believe, unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This silence and this avoidance I sustained with decent constancy, till
      during the storm, in an ill-fated moment, I saw, or thought I saw you in
      some danger, and then, all caution off guard, all resolution surprised,
      every passion awake, and tenderness triumphant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, angrily, &ldquo;and for what purpose all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, I know not!&rdquo; said he, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;I thought myself better
      qualified for this conference, and meant to be firm and concise. I have
      told my story ill, but as your own understanding will point out the cause,
      your own benevolence will perhaps urge some excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too certain, since that unfortunate accident, that all disguise was vain,
      and convinced by your displeasure of the impropriety of which I had been
      guilty, I determined, as the only apology I could offer, to open to you my
      whole heart, and then fly you perhaps for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, madam, incoherently indeed, yet with sincerity, I have now done; my
      sufferings and my conflicts I do not mention, for I dare not! O were I to
      paint to you the bitter struggles of a mind all at war with itself,&mdash;Duty,
      spirit, and fortitude, combating love, happiness and inclination,&mdash;each
      conquering alternately, and alternately each vanquished,&mdash;I could
      endure it no longer, I resolved by one effort to finish the strife, and to
      undergo an instant of even exquisite torture, in preference to a
      continuance of such lingering misery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The restoration of your health, Sir, and since you fancy it has been
      injured, of your happiness,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;will, I hope, be as speedy, as
      I doubt not they are certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Since I fancy it has been injured!</i>&rdquo; repeated he; &ldquo;what a phrase,
      after an avowal such as mine! But why should I wish to convince you of my
      sincerity, when to you it cannot be more indifferent, than to myself it is
      unfortunate! I have now only to entreat your pardon for the robbery I have
      committed upon your time, and to repeat my acknowledgments that you have
      endeavoured to hear me with patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you honour me, Sir, with some portion of your esteem,&rdquo; said the
      offended Cecilia, &ldquo;these acknowledgments, perhaps, should be mine; suppose
      them, however made, for I have a letter to write, and can therefore stay
      no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I presume, madam,&rdquo; cried he proudly, &ldquo;to detain you; hitherto you
      may frequently have thought me mysterious, sometimes strange and
      capricious, and perhaps almost always, unmeaning; to clear myself from
      these imputations, by a candid confession of the motives which have
      governed me, is all that I wished. Once, also&mdash;I hope but once,&mdash;you
      thought me impertinent,&mdash;there, indeed, I less dare vindicate myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no occasion, Sir,&rdquo; interrupted she, walking towards the door,
      &ldquo;for further vindication in any thing; I am perfectly satisfied, and if my
      good wishes are worth your acceptance, assure yourself you possess them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbarous, and insulting!&rdquo; cried he, half to himself; and then, with a
      quick motion hastening to open the door for her, &ldquo;Go, madam,&rdquo; he added,
      almost breathless with conflicting emotions, &ldquo;go, and be your happiness
      unalterable as your inflexibility!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was turning back to answer this reproach, but the sight of Lady
      Honoria, who was entering at the other door, deterred her, and she went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to her own room, she walked about it some time in a state so
      unsettled, between anger and disappointment, sorrow and pride, that she
      scarce knew to which emotion to give way, and felt almost bursting with
      each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The die,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is at last thrown; and this affair is concluded for
      ever! Delvile himself is content to relinquish me; no father has
      commanded, no mother has interfered, he has required no admonition, full
      well enabled to act for himself by the powerful instigation of hereditary
      arrogance! Yet my family, he says,&mdash;unexpected condescension! my
      family and every other circumstance is unexceptionable; how feeble, then,
      is that regard which yields to one only objection! how potent that
      haughtiness which to nothing will give way! Well, let him keep his name!
      since so wondrous its properties, so all-sufficient its preservation, what
      vanity, what presumption in me, to suppose myself an equivalent for its
      loss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, deeply offended, her spirits were supported by resentment, and not
      only while in company, but when alone, she found herself scarce averse to
      the approaching separation, and enabled to endure it without repining.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER x. &mdash; A RETREAT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Cecilia arose late, not only to avoid the raillery of
      Lady Honoria, but to escape seeing the departure of Delvile; she knew that
      the spirit with which she had left him, made him, at present, think her
      wholly insensible, and she was at least happy to be spared the
      mortification of a discovery, since she found him thus content, without
      even solicitation, to resign her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she was dressed, Lady Honoria ran into her room, &ldquo;A new scheme of
      politics!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;our great statesman intends to leave us; he can't
      trust his baby out of his sight, so he is going to nurse him while upon
      the road himself. Poor pretty dear Mortimer! what a puppet do they make of
      him! I have a vast inclination to get a pap-boat myself, and make him a
      present of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then enquired further particulars, and heard that Mr Delvile
      purposed accompanying his son to Bristol, whose journey, therefore, was
      postponed for a few hours to give time for new preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile, who, upon this occasion, thought himself overwhelmed with
      business, because, before his departure, he had some directions to give to
      his domestics, chose to breakfast in his own apartment; Mrs Delvile, also,
      wishing for some private conversation with her son, invited him to partake
      of hers in her dressing-room, sending an apology to her guests, and
      begging they would order their breakfasts when they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile, scrupulous in ceremony, had made sundry apologies to Lord
      Ernolf for leaving him; but his real anxiety for his son overpowering his
      artificial character, the excuses he gave to that nobleman were such as
      could not possibly offend; and the views of his lordship himself in his
      visit, being nothing interrupted, so long as Cecilia continued at the
      castle, he readily engaged, as a proof that he was not affronted, to
      remain with Mrs Delvile till his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, therefore, had her breakfast with the two lords and Lady Honoria;
      and when it was over, Lord Ernolf proposed to his son riding the first
      stage with the two Mr Delviles on horseback. This was agreed upon, and
      they left the room; and then Lady Honoria, full of frolic and gaiety,
      seized one of the napkins, and protested she would send it to Mortimer for
      a <i>slabbering-bib</i>; she therefore made it up in a parcel, and wrote
      upon the inside of the paper with which she enveloped it, &ldquo;A <i>pin-a fore</i>
      for Master Mortimer Delvile, lest he should daub his pappy when he is
      feeding him.&rdquo; Eager to have this properly conveyed, she then ran out, to
      give it in charge to her own man, who was to present him with it as he got
      into the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had but just quitted the room, when the door of it was again opened,
      and by Mortimer himself, booted, and equipped for his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley here! and alone!&rdquo; cried he, with a look, and in a voice,
      which shewed that all the pride of the preceding evening was sunk into the
      deepest dejection; &ldquo;and does she not fly as I approach her? can she
      patiently bear in her sight one so strange, so fiery, so inconsistent? But
      she is too wise to resent the ravings of a madman;&mdash;and who, under
      the influence of a passion at once hopeless and violent, can boast, but at
      intervals, full possession of his reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, utterly astonished by a gentleness so humble, looked at him in
      silent surprise; he advanced to her mournfully, and added, &ldquo;I am ashamed,
      indeed, of the bitterness of spirit with which I last night provoked your
      displeasure, when I should have supplicated your lenity; but though I was
      prepared for your coldness, I could not endure it, and though your
      indifference was almost friendly, it made me little less than frantic; so
      strangely may justice be blinded by passion, and every faculty of reason
      be warped by selfishness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no apology to make, Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;since, believe me, I
      require none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well,&rdquo; returned he, half-smiling, &ldquo;dispense with my apologies,
      since under the sanction of that word, I obtained your hearing yesterday.
      But, believe me, you will now find me far more reasonable; a whole night's
      reflections&mdash;reflections which no repose interrupted!&mdash;have
      brought me to my senses. Even lunatics, you know, have lucid moments!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend, Sir, to set off soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so; I wait only for my father. But why is Miss Beverley so
      impatient? I shall not soon <i>return</i>; that, at least, is certain,
      and, for a few instants delay, may surely offer some palliation;&mdash;See!
      if I am not ready to again accuse you of severity!&mdash;I must run, I
      find, or all my boasted reformation will end but in fresh offence, fresh
      disgrace, and fresh contrition! Adieu, madam!&mdash;and may all prosperity
      attend you! That will be ever my darling wish, however long my absence,
      however distant the climates which may part us!&rdquo; He was then hurrying
      away, but Cecilia, from an impulse of surprise too sudden to be
      restrained, exclaimed &ldquo;The climates?&mdash;do you, then, mean to leave
      England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he, with quickness, &ldquo;for why should I remain in it? a few
      weeks only could I fill up in any tour so near home, and hither in a few
      weeks to return would be folly and madness; in an absence so brief, what
      thought but that of the approaching meeting would occupy me? and what, at
      that meeting, should I feel, but joy the most dangerous, and delight which
      I dare not think of!&mdash;every conflict renewed, every struggle re-felt,
      again all this scene would require to be acted, again I must tear myself
      away, and every tumultuous passion now beating in my heart would be
      revived, and, if possible, be revived with added misery!&mdash;No!&mdash;neither
      my temper nor my constitution will endure such another shock, one parting
      shall suffice, and the fortitude with which I will lengthen my self-exile,
      shall atone to myself for the weakness which makes it requisite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a vehemence that seemed fearful of the smallest delay, he
      was again, and yet more hastily going, when Cecilia, with much emotion,
      called out, &ldquo;Two moments, Sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand! two million!&rdquo; cried he, impetuously, and returning, with a
      look of the most earnest surprise, he added, &ldquo;What is it Miss Beverley
      will condescend to command?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; cried she, recovering her presence of mind, &ldquo;but to beg you
      will by no means, upon my account, quit your country and your friends,
      since another asylum can be found for myself, and since I would much
      sooner part from Mrs Delvile, greatly and sincerely as I reverence her,
      than be instrumental to robbing her, even for a month, of her son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generous and humane is the consideration,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;but who half so
      generous, so humane as Miss Beverley? so soft to all others, so noble in
      herself? Can my mother have a wish, when I leave her with you? No; she is
      sensible of your worth, she adores you, almost as I adore you myself! you
      are now under her protection, you seem, indeed, born for each other; let
      me not, then, deprive her of so honourable a charge&mdash;Oh, why must he,
      who sees in such colours the excellencies of both, who admires with such
      fervour the perfections you unite, be torn with this violence from the
      objects he reveres, even though half his life he would sacrifice, to spend
      in their society what remained!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, who now felt her courage decline, and the
      softness of sorrow steal fast upon her spirits, &ldquo;if you will not give up
      your scheme, let me no longer detain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not wish me a good journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;very sincerely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you pardon the unguarded errors which have offended you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think of them, Sir, no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, then, most amiable of women, and may every blessing you deserve
      light on your head! I leave to you my mother, certain of your sympathetic
      affection for a character so resembling your own. When <i>you</i>, madam,
      leave her, may the happy successor in your favour&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, his
      voice faultered, Cecilia, too, turned away from him, and, uttering a deep
      sigh, he caught her hand, and pressing it to his lips, exclaimed, &ldquo;O great
      be your felicity, in whatever way you receive it!&mdash;pure as your
      virtues, and warm as your benevolence!&mdash;Oh too lovely Miss Beverley!&mdash;why,
      why must I quit you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though she trusted not her voice to reprove him, forced away her
      hand, and then, in the utmost perturbation, he rushed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scene for Cecilia, was the most unfortunate that could have happened;
      the gentleness of Delvile was alone sufficient to melt her, since her
      pride had no subsistence when not fed by his own; and while his mildness
      had blunted her displeasure, his anguish had penetrated her heart. Lost in
      thought and in sadness, she continued fixed to her seat; and looking at
      the door through which he had passed, as if, with himself, he had shut out
      all for which she existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pensive dejection was not long uninterrupted; Lady Honoria came
      running back, with intelligence, in what manner she had disposed of her
      napkin, and Cecilia in listening, endeavoured to find some diversion; but
      her ladyship, though volatile not undiscerning, soon perceived that her
      attention was constrained, and looking at her with much archness, said, &ldquo;I
      believe, my dear, I must find another napkin for <i>you!</i> not, how
      ever, for your <i>mouth</i>, but for your <i>eyes!</i> Has Mortimer been
      in to take leave of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take leave of me?&mdash;No,&mdash;is he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, Pappy has a world of business to settle first; he won't be ready
      these two hours. But don't look so sorrowful, for I'll run and bring
      Mortimer to console you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away she flew, and Cecilia, who had no power to prevent her, finding her
      spirits unequal either to another parting, or to the raillery of Lady
      Honoria, should Mortimer, for his own sake, avoid it, took refuge in
      flight, and seizing an umbrella, escaped into the park; where, to perplex
      any pursuers, instead of chusing her usual walk, she directed her steps to
      a thick and unfrequented wood, and never rested till she was more than two
      miles from the house. Fidel, however, who now always accompanied her, ran
      by her side, and, when she thought herself sufficiently distant and
      private to be safe, she sat down under a tree, and caressing her faithful
      favourite, soothed her own tenderness by lamenting that <i>he</i> had lost
      his master; and, having now no part to act, and no dignity to support, no
      observation to fear, and no inference to guard against, she gave vent to
      her long smothered emotions, by weeping without caution or restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had met with an object whose character answered all her wishes for him
      with whom she should entrust her fortune, and whose turn of mind, so
      similar to her own, promised her the highest domestic felicity; to this
      object her affections had involuntarily bent, they were seconded by
      esteem, and unchecked by any suspicion of impropriety in her choice; she
      had found too, in return, that his heart was all her own; her birth,
      indeed, was inferior, but it was not disgraceful; her disposition,
      education and temper seemed equal to his fondest wishes; yet, at the very
      time when their union appeared most likely, when they mixed with the same
      society, and dwelt under the same roof, when the father to one, was the
      guardian to the other, and interest seemed to invite their alliance even
      more than affection, the young man himself, without counsel or command,
      could tear himself from her presence by an effort all his own, forbear to
      seek her heart, and almost charge her not to grant it, and determining
      upon voluntary exile, quit his country and his connections with no view,
      and for no reason, but merely that he might avoid the sight of her he
      loved!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the motive for this conduct was now no longer unknown to her, she
      neither thought it satisfactory nor necessary; yet, while she censured his
      flight, she bewailed his loss, and though his inducement was repugnant to
      her opinion, his command over his passions she admired and applauded.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER xi. &mdash; A WORRY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cecilia continued in this private spot, happy at least to be alone, till
      she was summoned by the dinner bell to return home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she entered the parlour, where every body was assembled before
      her, she observed, by the countenance of Mrs Delvile, that she had passed
      the morning as sadly as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, before she was seated, &ldquo;I insist upon
      your taking my place to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I cannot suffer you to sit by a window with such a terrible
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship is very good, but indeed I have not any cold at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my dear, I must beg your pardon there; your eyes are quite bloodshot;
      Mrs Delvile, Lord Ernolf, are not her eyes quite red?&mdash;Lord, and so I
      protest are her cheeks! now do pray look in the glass, I assure you you
      will hardly know yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, who regarded her with the utmost kindness, affected to
      understand Lady Honoria's speech literally, both to lessen her apparent
      confusion, and the suspicious surmises of Lord Ernolf; she therefore said,
      &ldquo;you have indeed a bad cold, my love; but shade your eyes with your hat,
      and after dinner you shall bathe them in rose water, which will soon take
      off the inflammation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, perceiving her intention, for which she felt the utmost
      gratitude, no longer denied her cold, nor refused the offer of Lady
      Honoria; who, delighting in mischief, whencesoever it proceeded, presently
      added, &ldquo;This cold is a judgment upon you for leaving me alone all this
      morning; but I suppose you chose a tête-à-tête with your favourite,
      without the intrusion of any third person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here every body stared, and Cecilia very seriously declared she had been
      quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible you can so forget yourself?&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria; &ldquo;had you
      not your dearly beloved with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who now comprehended that she meant Fidel, coloured more deeply
      than ever, but attempted to laugh, and began eating her dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here seems some matter of much intricacy,&rdquo; cried Lord Ernolf, &ldquo;but, to
      me, wholly unintelligible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to me also,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;but I am content to let it remain
      so; for the mysteries of Lady Honoria are so frequent, that they deaden
      curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam, that is very unnatural,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;for I am sure
      you must long to know who I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do, at least,&rdquo; said Lord Ernolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, my lord, you must know, Miss Beverley has two companions, and I
      am one, and Fidel is the other; but Fidel was with her all this morning,
      and she would not admit me to the conference. I suppose she had something
      private to say to him of his master's journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rattle is this?&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile; &ldquo;Fidel is gone with my son, is
      he not?&rdquo; turning to the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, Mr Mortimer did not enquire for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very strange,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I never knew him quit home without him
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear ma'am, if he had taken him,&rdquo; cried Lady Honoria, &ldquo;what could poor
      Miss Beverley have done? for she has no friend here but him and me, and
      really he's so much the greater favourite, that it is well if I do not
      poison him some day for very spite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had no resource but in forcing a laugh, and Mrs Delvile, who
      evidently felt for her, contrived soon to change the subject; yet not
      before Lord Ernolf, with infinite chagrin, was certain by all that passed
      of the hopeless state of affairs for his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the day, and every hour of the two days following, Cecilia
      passed in the most comfortless constraint, fearful of being a moment
      alone, lest the heaviness of her heart should seek relief in tears, which
      consolation, melancholy as it was, she found too dangerous for indulgence;
      yet the gaiety of Lady Honoria lost all power of entertainment, and even
      the kindness of Mrs Delvile, now she imputed it to compassion, gave her
      more mortification than pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day, letters arrived from Bristol; but they brought with them
      nothing of comfort, for though Mortimer wrote gaily, his father sent word
      that his fever seemed threatening to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile was now in the extremest anxiety; and the task of Cecilia in
      appearing chearful and unconcerned, became more and more difficult to
      perform. Lord Ernolf's efforts to oblige her grew as hopeless to himself,
      as they were irksome to her; and Lady Honoria alone, of the whole house,
      could either find or make the smallest diversion. But while Lord Derford
      remained, she had still an object for ridicule, and while Cecilia could
      colour and be confused, she had still a subject for mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed a week, during which the news from Bristol being every day
      less and less pleasant, Mrs Delvile shewed an earnest desire to make a
      journey thither herself, and proposed, half laughing and half seriously,
      that the whole party should accompany her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria's time, however, was already expired, and her father intended
      to send for her in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile, who knew that such a charge would occupy all her time,
      willingly deferred setting out till her ladyship should be gone, but wrote
      word to Bristol that she should shortly be there, attended by the two
      lords, who insisted upon escorting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia now was in a state of the utmost distress; her stay at the castle
      she knew kept Delvile at a distance; to accompany his mother to Bristol,
      was forcing herself into his sight, which equally from prudence and pride
      she wished to avoid; and even Mrs Delvile evidently desired her absence,
      since whenever the journey was talked of, she preferably addressed herself
      to any one else who was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      All she could devise to relieve herself from a situation so painful, was
      begging permission to make a visit without delay to her old friend Mrs
      Charlton in Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This resolution taken, she put it into immediate execution, and seeking
      Mrs Delvile, enquired if she might venture to make a petition to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;but let it not be very disagreeable, since I
      feel already that I can refuse you nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an old friend, ma'am,&rdquo; she then cried, speaking fast, and in much
      haste to have done, &ldquo;who I have not for many months seen, and, as <i>my</i>
      health does not require a Bristol journey,&mdash;if you would honour me
      with mentioning my request to Mr Delvile, I think I might take the present
      opportunity of making Mrs Charlton a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Delvile looked at her some time without speaking, and then, fervently
      embracing her, &ldquo;sweet Cecilia!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;yes, you are all that I
      thought you! good, wise, discreet, tender, and noble at once!&mdash;how to
      part with you, indeed, I know not,&mdash;but you shall do as you please,
      for that I am sure will be right, and therefore I will make no
      opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia blushed and thanked her, yet saw but too plainly that all the
      motives of her scheme were clearly comprehended. She hastened, therefore,
      to write to Mrs Charlton, and prepare for her reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile, though with his usual formality, sent his permission; and
      Mortimer at the same time, begged his mother would bring with her Fidel,
      whom he had unluckily forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria, who was present when Mrs Delvile mentioned this commission,
      said in a whisper to Cecilia, &ldquo;Miss Beverley, don't let him go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you had a great deal better take him slyly into Suffolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would as soon,&rdquo; answered Cecilia, &ldquo;take with me the side-board of
      plate, for I should scarcely think it more a robbery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, I am sure they might all take such a theft for an
      honour; and if I was going to Bristol, I would bid Mortimer send him to
      you immediately. However, if you wish it, I will write to him. He's my
      cousin, you know, so there will be no great impropriety in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia thanked her for so courteous an offer, but entreated that she
      might by no means draw her into such a condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then made immediate preparations for her journey into Suffolk, which
      she saw gave equal surprize and chagrin to Lord Ernolf, upon whose affairs
      Mrs Delvile herself now desired to speak with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Miss Beverley,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;briefly and positively your opinion
      of Lord Derford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of him so little, madam,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that I cannot say of him
      much; he appears, however, to be inoffensive; but, indeed, were I never to
      see him again, he is one of those I should forget I had ever seen at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so exactly the case with myself also,&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;that
      to plead for him, I find utterly impossible, though my Lord Ernolf has
      strongly requested me; but to press such an alliance, I should think an
      indignity to your understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was much gratified by this speech; but she soon after added,
      &ldquo;There is one reason, indeed, which would render such a connection
      desirable, though that is only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why so? I am sure I have no ambition of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my love,&rdquo; said Mrs Delvile, smiling, &ldquo;I mean not by way of
      gratification to <i>your</i> pride, but to <i>his</i>; since a title, by
      taking place of a family name, would obviate the <i>only</i> objection
      that <i>any</i> man could form to an alliance with Miss Beverley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who too well understood her, suppressed a sigh, and changed the
      subject of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day was sufficient for all the preparations she required, and, as she
      meant to set out very early the next morning, she took leave of Lady
      Honoria, and the Lords Ernolf and Derford, when they separated for the
      night; but Mrs Delvile followed her to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She expressed her concern at losing her in the warmest and most flattering
      terms, yet said nothing of her coming back, nor of the length of her stay;
      she desired, however, to hear from her frequently, and assured her that
      out of her own immediate family, there was nobody in the world she so
      tenderly valued.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued with her till it grew so late that they were almost
      necessarily parted; and then rising to be gone, &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;with
      what reluctance I quit you! no interest but so dear a one as that which
      calls me away, should induce me, with my own consent, to bear your absence
      scarcely an hour; but the world is full of mortifications, and to endure,
      or to sink under them, makes all the distinction between the noble or the
      weak-minded. To <i>you</i> this may be said with safety; to most young
      women it would pass for a reflection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said Cecilia, smothering the emotions to which this
      speech gave rise, &ldquo;and if indeed you honour me with an opinion so
      flattering, I will endeavour, if it is possibly in my power, not to
      forfeit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my love!&rdquo; cried Mrs Delvile warmly, &ldquo;if upon my opinion of you alone
      depended our residence with each other, when should we ever part, and how
      live a moment asunder? But what title have I to monopolize two such
      blessings? the mother of Mortimer Delvile should at nothing repine; the
      mother of Cecilia Beverley had alone equal reason to be proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are determined, madam,&rdquo; said Cecilia, forcing a smile, &ldquo;that I <i>shall</i>
      be worthy, by giving me the sweetest of motives, that of deserving such
      praise.&rdquo; And then, in a faint voice, she desired her respects to Mr
      Delvile, and added, &ldquo;you will find, I hope, every body at Bristol better
      than you expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;and that you too, will find your Mrs Charlton
      well, happy, and good as you left her; but suffer her not to drive me from
      your remembrance, and never fancy that because she has known you longer,
      she loves you more; my acquaintance with you, though short, has been
      critical, and she must hear from you a world of anecdotes, before she can
      have reason to love you as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, tears starting into her eyes, &ldquo;let us part
      now!&mdash;where will be that strength of mind you expect from me, if I
      listen to you any longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my love,&rdquo; answered Mrs Delvile, &ldquo;since all tenderness
      enfeebles fortitude.&rdquo; Then affectionately embracing her, &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;sweetest Cecilia, amiable and most excellent creature, adieu!&mdash;you,
      carry with you my highest approbation, my love, my esteem, my fondest
      wishes!&mdash;and shall I&mdash;yes, generous girl! I <i>will</i> add my
      warmest gratitude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last word she spoke almost in a whisper, again kissed her, and
      hastened out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, surprised and affected, gratified and depressed, remained almost
      motionless, and could not, for a great length of time, either ring for her
      maid, or persuade herself to go to rest. She saw throughout the whole
      behaviour of Mrs Delvile, a warmth of regard which, though strongly
      opposed by family pride, made her almost miserable to promote the very
      union she thought necessary to discountenance; she saw, too, that it was
      with the utmost difficulty she preserved the steadiness of her opposition,
      and that she had a conflict perpetual with herself, to forbear openly
      acknowledging the contrariety of her wishes, and the perplexity of her
      distress; but chiefly she was struck with her expressive use of the word
      gratitude. &ldquo;Wherefore should she be grateful,&rdquo; thought Cecilia, &ldquo;what have
      I done, or had power to do? infinitely, indeed, is she deceived, if she
      supposes that her son has acted by my directions; my influence with him is
      nothing, and he could not be more his own master, were he utterly
      indifferent to me. To conceal my own disappointment has, been all I have
      attempted; and perhaps she may think of me thus highly, from supposing
      that the firmness of her son is owing to my caution and reserve; ah, she
      knows him not!&mdash;were my heart at this moment laid open to him,&mdash;were
      all its weakness, its partiality, its ill-fated admiration displayed, he
      would but double his vigilance to avoid and forget me, and find the task
      all the easier by his abatement of esteem. Oh strange infatuation of
      unconquerable prejudice! his very life will he sacrifice in preference to
      his name, and while the conflict of his mind threatens to level him with
      the dust, he disdains to unite himself where one wish is unsatisfied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These reflections, and the uncertainty if she should ever in Delvile
      Castle sleep again, disturbed her the whole night, and made all calling in
      the morning unnecessary; she arose at five o'clock, dressed herself with
      the utmost heaviness of heart, and in going through a long gallery which
      led to the staircase, as she passed the door of Mortimer's chamber, the
      thought of his ill health, his intended long journey, and the probability
      that she might never see him more, so deeply impressed and saddened her,
      that scarcely could she force herself to proceed, without stopping to weep
      and to pray for him; she was surrounded, however, by servants, and
      compelled therefore to hasten to the chaise; she flung herself in, and,
      leaning back, drew her hat over her eyes, and thought, as the carriage
      drove off, her last hope of earthly happiness extinguished.

      CHAPTER i. &mdash; A RENOVATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cecilia was accompanied by her maid in the chaise, and her own servant and
      one of Mrs Delvile's attended her on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quietness of her dejection was soon interrupted by a loud cry among
      the men of &ldquo;home! home! home!&rdquo; She then looked out of one of the windows,
      and perceived Fidel, running after the carriage, and barking at the
      servants, who were all endeavouring to send him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched by this proof of the animal's gratitude for her attention to him,
      and conscious she had herself occasioned his master's leaving him, the
      scheme of Lady Honoria occurred to her, and she almost wished to put it in
      execution, but this was the thought of a moment, and motioning him with
      her hand to go back, she desired Mrs Delvile's man to return with him
      immediately, and commit him to the care of somebody in the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little incident, however trifling, was the most important of her
      journey, for she arrived at the house of Mrs Charlton without meeting any
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of that lady gave her a sensation of pleasure to which she had
      long been a stranger, pleasure pure, unmixed, unaffected and unrestrained;
      it revived all her early affection, and with it, something resembling at
      least her early tranquility; again she was in the house where it had once
      been undisturbed, again she enjoyed the society which was once all she had
      wished, and again saw the same scene, the same faces, and same prospects
      she had beheld while her heart was all devoted to her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton, though old and infirm, preserved an understanding, which,
      whenever unbiassed by her affections, was sure to direct her unerringly;
      but the extreme softness of her temper frequently misled her judgment, by
      making it, at the pleasure either of misfortune or of artifice, always
      yield to compassion, and pliant to entreaty. Where her counsel and opinion
      were demanded, they were certain to reflect honour on her capacity and
      discernment; but where her assistance or her pity were supplicated, her
      purse and her tears were immediately bestowed, and in her zeal to
      alleviate distress she forgot if the object were deserving her solicitude,
      and stopt not to consider propriety or discretion, if happiness, however
      momentary, were in her power to grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This generous foible was, however, kept somewhat in subjection by the
      watchfulness of two grand-daughters, who, fearing the injury they might
      themselves receive from it, failed not to point out both its inconvenience
      and its danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ladies were daughters of a deceased and only son of Mrs Charlton;
      they were single, and lived with their grand-mother, whose fortune, which
      was considerable, they expected to share between them, and they waited
      with eagerness for the moment of appropriation; narrow-minded and
      rapacious, they wished to monopolize whatever she possessed, and thought
      themselves aggrieved by her smallest donations. Their chief employment was
      to keep from her all objects of distress, and in this though they could
      not succeed, they at least confined her liberality to such as resembled
      themselves; since neither the spirited could brook, nor the delicate
      support the checks and rebuffs from the granddaughters, which followed the
      gifts of Mrs Charlton. Cecilia, of all her acquaintance, was the only one
      whose intimacy they encouraged, for they knew her fortune made her
      superior to any mercenary views, and they received from her themselves
      more civilities than they paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton loved Cecilia with an excess of fondness, that not only took
      place of the love she bore her other friends, but to which even her regard
      for the Miss Charltons was inferior and feeble. Cecilia when a child had
      reverenced her as a mother, and, grateful for her tenderness and care, had
      afterwards cherished her as a friend. The revival of this early connection
      delighted them both, it was balm to the wounded mind of Cecilia, it was
      renovation to the existence of Mrs Charlton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning she wrote a card to Mr Monckton and Lady Margaret,
      acquainting them with her return into Suffolk, and desiring to know when
      she might pay her respects to her Ladyship. She received from the old lady
      a verbal answer, <i>when she pleased</i>, but Mr Monckton came instantly
      himself to Mrs Charlton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      His astonishment, his rapture at this unexpected incident were almost
      boundless; he thought it a sudden turn of fortune in his own favour, and
      concluded, now she had escaped the danger of Delvile Castle, the road was
      short and certain that led to his own security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her satisfaction in the meeting was as sincere, though not so animated as
      his own; but this similarity in their feelings was of short duration, for
      when he enquired into what had passed at the castle, with the reasons of
      her quitting it, the pain she felt in giving even a cursory and evasive
      account, was opposed on his part by the warmest delight in hearing it; he
      could not obtain from her the particulars of what had happened, but the
      reluctance with which she spoke, the air of mortification with which she
      heard his questions, and the evident displeasure which was mingled in her
      chagrin, when he forced her to mention Delvile, were all proofs the most
      indisputable and satisfactory, that they had either parted without any
      explanation, or with one by which Cecilia had been hurt and offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now readily concluded that since the fiery trial he had most
      apprehended was over; and she had quitted in anger the asylum she had
      sought in extacy, Delvile himself did not covet the alliance, which, since
      they were separated, was never likely to take place. He had therefore
      little difficulty in promising all success to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was once more upon the spot where she had regarded him as the first of
      men, he knew that during her absence no one had settled in the
      neighbourhood who had any pretensions to dispute with him that
      pre-eminence, he should again have access to her, at pleasure, and so
      sanguine grew his hopes, that he almost began to rejoice even in the
      partiality to Delvile that had hitherto been his terror, from believing it
      would give her for a time, that sullen distaste of all other connections,
      to which those who at once are delicate and fervent are commonly led by
      early disappointment. His whole solicitude therefore now was to preserve
      her esteem, to seek her confidence, and to regain whatever by absence
      might be lost of the [ascendancy] over her mind which her respect for his
      knowledge and capacity had for many years given him. Fortune at this time
      seemed to prosper all his views, and, by a stroke the most sudden and
      unexpected, to render more rational his hopes and his plans than he had
      himself been able to effect by the utmost craft of worldly wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following Cecilia, in Mrs Charlton's chaise, waited upon Lady
      Margaret. She was received by Miss Bennet, her companion, with the most
      fawning courtesy; but when conducted to the lady of the house, she saw
      herself so evidently unwelcome, that she even regretted the civility which
      had prompted her visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found with her nobody but Mr Morrice, who was the only young man that
      could persuade himself to endure her company in the absence of her
      husband, but who, in common with most young men who are assiduous in their
      attendance upon old ladies, doubted not but he ensured himself a handsome
      legacy for his trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost the first speech which her ladyship made, was &ldquo;So you are not
      married yet, I find; if Mr Monckton had been a real friend, he would have
      taken care to have seen for some establishment for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was by no means,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with spirit, &ldquo;either in so much haste
      or distress as to require from Mr Monckton any such exertion of his
      friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;what a terrible night we had of it at Vauxhall!
      poor Harrel! I was really excessively sorry for him. I had not courage to
      see you or Mrs Harrel after it. But as soon as I heard you were in St
      James's-square, I tried to wait upon you; for really going to Mr Harrel's
      again would have been quite too dismal. I would rather have run a mile by
      the side of a race-horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no occasion for any apology,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;for I was very
      little disposed either to see or think of visitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought, ma'am;&rdquo; answered he, with quickness, &ldquo;and really that made
      me the less alert in finding you out. However, ma'am, next winter I shall
      be excessively happy to make up for the deficiency; besides, I shall be
      much obliged to you to introduce me to Mr Delvile, for I have a great
      desire to be acquainted with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Delvile, thought Cecilia, would be but too proud to hear it! However,
      she merely answered that she had no present prospect of spending any time
      at Mr. Delvile's next winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, ma'am, true,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;now I recollect, you become your own
      mistress between this and then; and so I suppose you will naturally chuse
      a house of your own, which will be much more eligible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that,&rdquo; said Lady Margaret, &ldquo;I never saw anything eligible
      come of young women's having houses of their own; she will do a much
      better thing to marry, and have some proper person to take care of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more right, ma'am!&rdquo; returned he; &ldquo;a young lady in a house by
      herself must be subject to a thousand dangers. What sort of place, ma'am,
      has Mr Delvile got in the country? I hear he has a good deal of ground
      there, and a large house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an old castle, Sir, and situated in a park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be terribly forlorn; I dare say, ma'am, you were very happy to
      return into Suffolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not find it forlorn; I was very well satisfied with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed, upon second thoughts, I don't much wonder; an old castle in
      a large park must make a very romantic appearance; something noble in it,
      I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; cried Lady Margaret, &ldquo;they said you were to become mistress of it,
      and marry Mr Delvile's son and I cannot, for my own part, see any
      objection to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told of so many strange reports,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;and all, to myself
      so unaccountable, that I begin now to hear of them without much wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a charming young man, I believe,&rdquo; said Morrice; &ldquo;I had the
      pleasure once or twice of meeting him at poor Harrel's, and he seemed
      mighty agreeable. Is not he so, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I don't mean to speak of him as any thing very extraordinary,&rdquo; cried
      Morrice, imagining her hesitation proceeded from dislike, &ldquo;I merely meant
      as the world goes,&mdash;in a common sort of a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they were joined by Mr Monckton and some gentlemen who were on a
      visit at his house; for his anxiety was not of a sort to lead him to
      solitude, nor his disposition to make him deny himself any kind of
      enjoyment which he had power to attain. A general conversation ensued,
      which lasted till Cecilia ended her visit; Mr Monckton then took her hand
      to lead her to the chaise, but told her, in their way out, of some
      alterations in his grounds, which he desired to shew her; his view of
      detaining her was to gather what she thought of her reception, and whether
      she had yet any suspicions of the jealousy of Lady Margaret; well knowing,
      from the delicacy of her character, that if once she became acquainted
      with it, she would scrupulously avoid all intercourse with him, from the
      fear of encreasing her uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began, therefore, with talking of the pleasure which Lady Margaret took
      in the plantations, and of his hope that Cecilia would often favour her by
      visiting them, without waiting to have her visits returned, as she was
      entitled by her infirmities to particular indulgencies. He was continuing
      in this strain, receiving from Cecilia hardly any answer, when suddenly
      from behind a thick laurel bush, jumpt up Mr Morrice; who had run out of
      the house by a shorter cut, and planted himself there to surprise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ho!&rdquo; cried he with a loud laugh, &ldquo;I have caught you! This will be a
      fine anecdote for Lady Margaret; I vow I'll tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton, never off his guard, readily answered &ldquo;Aye, prithee do,
      Morrice; but don't omit to relate also what we said of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; cried he, with some eagerness; &ldquo;why you never mentioned me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O that won't pass, I assure you; we shall tell another tale at table by
      and by; and bring the old proverb of the ill luck of listeners upon you in
      its full force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be hanged if I know what you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you won't pretend you did not hear Miss Beverley say you were the
      truest Ouran Outang, or man-monkey, she ever knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, that I did not!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&mdash;Nor how much she admired your dexterity in escaping being
      horse-whipt three times a day for your incurable impudence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word on't! Horse-whipt!&mdash;Miss Beverley, pray did you say any
      such thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried Monckton, again, &ldquo;and not only horse-<i>whipt</i>, but horse-<i>ponded</i>,
      for she thought when, one had heated, the other might cool you; and then
      you might be fitted again for your native woods, for she insists upon it
      you was brought from Africa, and are not yet half tamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; cried Morrice, amazed, &ldquo;I should not have suspected Miss
      Beverley would have talked so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you suspect she did now?&rdquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho, pho,&rdquo; cried Monckton, coolly, &ldquo;why he heard it himself the whole
      time! and so shall all our party by and bye, if I can but remember to
      mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then returned to the chaise, leaving Mr Monckton to settle the
      matter with his credulous guest as he pleased; for supposing he was merely
      gratifying a love of sport, or taking this method of checking the general
      forwardness of the young man, she forbore any interference that might mar
      his intention. But Mr Monckton loved not to be rallied concerning Cecilia,
      though he was indifferent to all that could be said to him of any other
      woman; he meant, therefore, to intimidate Morrice from renewing the
      subject; and he succeeded to his wish; poor Morrice, whose watching and
      whose speech were the mere blunders of chance, made without the slightest
      suspicion of Mr Monckton's designs, now apprehended some scheme to render
      himself ridiculous, and though he did not believe Cecilia had made use of
      such expressions, he fancied Mr Monckton meant to turn the laugh against
      him, and determined, therefore, to say nothing that might remind him of
      what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton had at this time admitted him to his house merely from an
      expectation of finding more amusement in his blundering and giddiness,
      than he was capable, during his anxiety concerning Cecilia, of receiving
      from conversation of an higher sort. The character of Morrice was, indeed,
      particularly adapted for the entertainment of a large house in the
      country; eager for sport, and always ready for enterprize; willing to
      oblige, yet tormented with no delicacy about offending; the first to
      promote mischief for any other, and the last to be offended when exposed
      to it himself; gay, thoughtless, and volatile,-a happy composition of
      levity and good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, however, to quitting the house, determined not to visit it again
      very speedily; for she was extremely disgusted with Lady Margaret, though
      she suspected no particular motives of enmity, against which she was
      guarded alike by her own unsuspicious innocence, and by an high esteem of
      Mr Monckton, which she firmly believed he returned with equal honesty of
      undesigning friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her next excursion was to visit Mrs Harrel; she found that unhappy lady a
      prey to all the misery of unoccupied solitude; torn from whatever had, to
      her, made existence seem valuable, her mind was as listless as her person
      was inactive, and she was at a loss how to employ even a moment of the
      day; she had now neither a party to form, nor an entertainment to plan,
      company to arrange, nor dress to consider; and these, with visits and
      public places, had filled all her time since her marriage, which, as it
      had happened very early in her life, had merely taken place of girlish
      amusements, masters and governesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This helplessness of insipidity, however, though naturally the effect of a
      mind devoid of all genuine resources, was dignified by herself with the
      appellation of sorrow; nor was this merely a screen to the world; unused
      to investigate her feelings or examine her heart, the general compassion
      she met for the loss of her husband, persuaded her that indeed she
      lamented his destiny; though had no change in her life been caused by his
      suicide, she would scarcely, when the first shock was over, have thought
      of it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received Cecilia with great pleasure; and with still greater, heard
      the renewal of her promises to fit up a room for her in her house, as soon
      as she came of age; a period which now was hardly a month distant. Far
      greater, however, as well as infinitely purer, was the joy which her
      presence bestowed upon Mr Arnott; she saw it herself with a sensation of
      regret, not only at the constant passion which occasioned it, but even at
      her own inability to participate in or reward it for with him an alliance
      would meet with no opposition; his character was amiable, his situation in
      life unexceptionable; he loved her with the tenderest affection, and no
      pride, she well knew, would interfere to overpower it; yet, in return, to
      grant him her love, she felt as utterly impossible as to refuse him her
      esteem; and the superior attractions of Delvile, of which neither
      displeasure nor mortification could rob him, shut up her heart, for the
      present, more firmly than ever, as Mr Monckton had well imagined, to all
      other assailants. Yet she by no means weakly gave way to repining or
      regret; her suspence was at an end, her hopes and her fears were subsided
      into certainty; Delvile, in quitting her, had acquainted her that he had
      left her for ever, and even, though not, indeed, with much steadiness, had
      prayed for her happiness in union with some other; she held it therefore
      as essential to her character as to her peace, to manifest equal fortitude
      in subduing her partiality; she forbore to hint to Mrs Charlton what had
      passed, that the subject might never be started; allowed herself no time
      for dangerous recollection; strolled in her old walks, and renewed her old
      acquaintance, and by a vigorous exertion of active wisdom, doubted not
      compleating, before long, the subjection of her unfortunate tenderness.
      Nor was her task so difficult as she had feared; resolution, in such
      cases, may act the office of time, and anticipate by reason and
      self-denial, what that, much less nobly, effects through forgetfulness and
      inconstancy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ii. &mdash; A VISIT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One week only, however, had yet tried the perseverance of Cecilia, when,
      while she was working with Mrs Charlton in her dressing-room, her maid
      hastily entered it, and with a smile that seemed announcing welcome news,
      said, &ldquo;Lord, ma'am, here's Fidel!&rdquo; and, at the same moment, she was
      followed by the dog, who jumpt upon Cecilia in a transport of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven,&rdquo; cried she, all amazement, &ldquo;who has brought him? whence does
      he come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A country man brought him, ma'am; but he only put him in, and would not
      stay a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whom did he enquire for?&mdash;who saw him?&mdash;what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw Ralph, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph, then, was instantly called; and these questions being repeated, he
      said, &ldquo;Ma'am, it was a man I never saw before; but he only bid me take
      care to deliver the dog into your own hands, and said you would have a
      letter about him soon, and then went away; I wanted him to stay till I
      came up stairs, but he was off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, quite confounded by this account, could make neither comment nor
      answer; but, as soon as the servants had left the room, Mrs Charlton
      entreated to know to whom the dog had belonged, convinced by her extreme
      agitation, that something interesting and uncommon must relate to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no time for disguise; astonishment and confusion bereft Cecilia
      of all power to attempt it; and, after a very few evasions, she briefly
      communicated her situation with respect to Delvile, his leaving her, his
      motives, and his mother's evident concurrence; for these were all so
      connected with her knowledge of Fidel, that she led to them unavoidably in
      telling what she knew of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very little penetration was requisite, to gather from her manner all that
      was united in her narrative of her own feelings and disappointment in the
      course of this affair; and Mrs Charlton, who had hitherto believed the
      whole world at her disposal, and that she continued single from no reason
      but her own difficulty of choice, was utterly amazed to find that any man
      existed who could withstand the united allurements of so much beauty,
      sweetness, and fortune. She felt herself sometimes inclined to hate, and
      at other times to pity him; yet concluded that her own extreme coldness
      was the real cause of his flight, and warmly blamed a reserve which had
      thus ruined her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was in the extremest perplexity and distress to conjecture the
      meaning of so unaccountable a present, and so strange a message. Delvile,
      she knew, had desired the dog might follow him to Bristol; his mother,
      always pleased to oblige him, would now less than ever neglect any
      opportunity; she could not, therefore, doubt that she had sent or taken
      him thither, and thence, according to all appearances, he must now come.
      But was it likely Delvile would take such a liberty? Was it probable, when
      so lately he had almost exhorted her to forget him, he would even wish to
      present her with such a remembrance of himself? And what was the letter
      she was bid to expect? Whence and from what was it to come?
    </p>
    <p>
      All was inexplicable! the only thing she could surmise, with any semblance
      of probability, was that the whole was some frolic of Lady Honoria
      Pemberton, who had persuaded Delvile to send her the dog, and perhaps
      assured him she had herself requested to have him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provoked by this suggestion, her first thought was instantly having him
      conveyed to the castle; but uncertain what the whole affair meant, and
      hoping some explanation in the letter she was promised, she determined to
      wait till it came, or at least till she heard from Mrs Delvile, before she
      took any measures herself in the business. Mutual accounts of their safe
      arrivals at Bristol and in Suffolk, had already passed between them, and
      she expected very soon to have further intelligence; though she was now,
      by the whole behaviour of Mrs Delvile, convinced she wished not again to
      have her an inmate of her house, and that the rest of her minority might
      pass, without opposition; in the house of Mrs Charlton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day, however, passed, and yet she heard nothing more; a week, a
      fortnight elapsed, and still no letter came. She now concluded the promise
      was a deception, and repented that she had waited a moment with any such
      expectation. Her peace, during this time, was greatly disturbed; this
      present made her fear she was thought meanly of by Mr Delvile; the silence
      of his mother gave her apprehensions for his health, and her own
      irresolution how to act, kept her in perpetual inquietude. She tried in
      vain to behave as if this incident had not happened; her mind was uneasy,
      and the same actions produced not the same effects; when she now worked or
      read, the sight of Fidel by her side distracted her attention; when she
      walked, it was the same, for Fidel always followed her; and though, in
      visiting her old acquaintance, she forbore to let him accompany her, she
      was secretly planning the whole time the contents of some letter, which
      she expected to meet with, on returning to Mrs Charlton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had
      paid their addresses to Cecilia, again waited upon her at Mrs Charlton's,
      and renewed their proposals. They had now, however, still less chance of
      success, and their dismission was brief and decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these came Mr Biddulph; and to him Cecilia was involuntarily most
      civil, because she knew him to be the friend of Delvile. Yet his
      conversation encreased the uneasiness of her suspence; for after speaking
      of the family in general which she had left, he enquired more particularly
      concerning Delvile, and then added, &ldquo;I am, indeed, greatly grieved to
      find, by all the accounts I receive of him, that he is now in a very bad
      state of health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech gave her fresh subject for apprehension; and in proportion as
      the silence of Mrs Delvile grew more alarming, her regard for her
      favourite Fidel became more partial. The affectionate animal seemed to
      mourn the loss of his master, and while sometimes she indulged herself in
      fancifully telling him her fears, she imagined she read in his countenance
      the faithfullest sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One week of her minority was now all that remained, and she was soon
      wholly occupied in preparations for coming of age. She purposed taking
      possession of a large house that had belonged to her uncle, which was
      situated only three miles from that of Mrs Charlton; and she employed
      herself in giving orders for fitting it up, and in hearing complaints, and
      promising indulgencies, to various of her tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, while she was at breakfast one morning, a letter arrived
      from Mrs Delvile. She apologised for not writing sooner, but added that
      various family occurrences, which had robbed her of all leisure, might
      easily be imagined, when she acquainted her that Mortimer had determined
      upon again going abroad.... They were all, she said, returned to Delvile
      Castle, but mentioned nothing either of the health of her son, or of her
      own regret, and filled up the rest of her letter, with general news and
      expressions of kindness; though, in a postscript, was inserted, &ldquo;We have
      lost our poor Fidel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was still meditating upon this letter, by which her perplexity how
      to act was rather encreased than diminished, when, to her great surprise,
      Lady Honoria Pemberton was announced. She hastily begged one of the Miss
      Charltons to convey Fidel out of sight, from a dread of her raillery,
      should she, at last, be unconcerned in the transaction, and then went to
      receive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria, who was with her governess, gave a brief history of her
      quitting Delvile Castle, and said she was now going with her father to
      visit a noble family in Norfolk; but she had obtained his permission to
      leave him at the inn where they had slept, in order to make a short
      excursion to Bury, for the pleasure of seeing Miss Beverley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I can stay but half an hour; so you must
      give me some account of yourself as fast as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What account does your ladyship require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who you live with here, and who are your companions, and what you do
      with yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I live with Mrs Charlton; and for companions, I have at least a
      score; here are her two grand-daughters, and Mrs and Miss&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pho, pho,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Honoria, &ldquo;but I don't mean such hum-drum
      companions as those; you'll tell me next, I suppose, of the parson and his
      wife and three daughters, with all their cousins and aunts; I hate those
      sort of people. What I desire to hear of is, who are your particular
      favourites; and whether you take long walks here, as you used to do at the
      Castle, and who you have to accompany you?&rdquo; And then, looking at her very
      archly, she added, &ldquo;A pretty little dog, now, I should think, would be
      vastly agreeable in such a place as this.&mdash;Ah, Miss Beverley! you
      have not left off that trick of colouring, I see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I colour now,&rdquo; said Cecilia, fully convinced of the justness of her
      suspicions, &ldquo;I think it must be for your ladyship, not myself; for, if I
      am not much mistaken, either in person, or by proxy, a blush from Lady
      Honoria Pemberton would not, just now, be wholly out of season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;how like that is to a speech of Mrs Delvile's! She has
      taught you exactly her manner of talking. But do you know I am informed
      you have got Fidel with you here? O fie, Miss Beverley! What will papa and
      mamma say, when they find you have taken away poor little master's
      plaything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And O fie, Lady Honoria! what shall <i>I</i> say, when I find you guilty
      of this mischievous frolic! I must beg, however, since you have gone thus
      far, that you will proceed a little farther, and send back the dog to the
      person from whom you received him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not I! manage him all your own way; if you chuse to accept dogs from
      gentlemen, you know, it is your affair, and not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really will not return him yourself, you must at least pardon me
      should you hear that <i>I</i> do in your ladyship's name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Honoria for some time only laughed and rallied, without coming to any
      explanation; but when she had exhausted all the sport she could make, she
      frankly owned that she had herself ordered the dog to be privately stolen,
      and then sent a man with him to Mrs Charlton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I really owed you a spite for being so
      ill-natured as to run away after sending me to call Mortimer to comfort
      and take leave of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dream, Lady Honoria? when did I send you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you know you looked as if you wished it, and that was the same thing.
      But really it made me appear excessively silly, when I had forced him to
      come back with me, and told him you were waiting for him,&mdash;to see
      nothing of you at all, and not be able to find or trace you. He took it
      all for my own invention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it <i>not</i> your own invention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that's nothing to the purpose; I wanted him to believe you sent me,
      for I knew else he would not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship was a great deal too good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why now suppose I had brought you together, what possible harm could have
      happened from it? It would merely have given each of you some notion of a
      fever and ague; for first you would both have been hot, and then you would
      both have been cold, and then you would both have turned red, and then you
      would both have turned white, and then you would both have pretended to
      simper at the trick; and then there would have been an end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very easy way of settling it all,&rdquo; cried Cecilia laughing;
      &ldquo;however, you must be content to abide by your own theft, for you cannot
      in conscience expect I should take it upon myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are terribly ungrateful, I see,&rdquo; said her ladyship, &ldquo;for all the
      trouble and contrivance and expence I have been at merely to oblige you,
      while the whole time, poor Mortimer, I dare say, has had his sweet Pet
      advertised in all the newspapers, and cried in every market-town in the
      kingdom. By the way, if you do send him back, I would advise you to let
      your man demand the reward that has been offered for him, which may serve
      in part of payment for his travelling expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia could only shake her head, and recollect Mrs Delvile's expression,
      that her levity was incorrigible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O if you had seen,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how sheepish Mortimer looked when I
      told him you were dying to see him before he set off! he coloured so!&mdash;just
      as you do now!&mdash;but I think you're vastly alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear, then,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, not very angry at this speech, &ldquo;there is
      but little chance your ladyship should like either of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, I do! I like odd people of all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd people? and in what are we so very odd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, in a thousand things. You're so good, you know, and so grave, and so
      squeamish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squeamish? how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know, you never laugh at the old folks, and never fly at your
      servants, nor smoke people before their faces, and are so civil to the old
      <i>fograms</i>, you would make one imagine you liked nobody so well. By
      the way, I could do no good with my little Lord Derford; he pretended to
      find out I was only laughing at him, and so he minded nothing I told him.
      I dare say, however, his father made the detection, for I am sure he had
      not wit enough to discover it himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then, very seriously began to entreat that she would return the
      dog herself, and confess her frolic, remonstrating in strong terms upon
      the mischievous tendency and consequences of such inconsiderate flights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried she, rising, &ldquo;this is all vastly true; but I have no time to
      hear any more of it just now; besides, it's only forestalling my next
      lecture from Mrs Delvile, for you talk so much alike, that it is really
      very perplexing to me to remember which is which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then hurried away, protesting she had already outstayed her father's
      patience, and declaring the delay of another minute would occasion half a
      dozen expresses to know whether she was gone towards Scotland or Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visit, however, was both pleasant and consolatory to Cecilia; who was
      now relieved from her suspence, and revived in her spirits by the
      intelligence that Delvile had no share in sending her a present, which,
      from him, would have been humiliating and impertinent. She regretted,
      indeed, that she had not instantly returned it to the castle, which she
      was now convinced was the measure she ought to have pursued; but to make
      all possible reparation, she determined that her own servant should set
      out with him the next morning to Bristol, and take a letter to Mrs Delvile
      to explain what had happened, since to conceal it from any delicacy to
      Lady Honoria, would be to expose herself to suspicions the most
      mortifying, for which that gay and careless young lady would never thank
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave orders, therefore, to her servant to get ready for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she communicated these little transactions to Mrs Charlton, that
      kind-hearted old lady, who knew her fondness for Fidel, advised her not
      yet to part with him, but merely to acquaint Mrs Delvile where he was, and
      what Lady Honoria had done, and, by leaving to herself the care of
      settling his restoration, to give her, at least, an opportunity of
      offering him to her acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, however, would listen to no such proposal; she saw the firmness
      of Delvile in his resolution to avoid her, and knew that policy, as well
      as propriety, made it necessary she should part with what she could only
      retain to remind her of one whom she now most wished to forget.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER iii. &mdash; AN INCIDENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spirits of Cecilia, however, internally failed her; she considered her
      separation from Delvile to be now, in all probability, for life, since she
      saw that no struggle either of interest, inclination, or health, could
      bend him from his purpose; his mother, too, seemed to regard his name and
      his existence as equally valuable, and the scruples of his father she was
      certain would be still more insurmountable. Her own pride, excited by
      theirs, made her, indeed, with more anger than sorrow, see this general
      consent to abandon her; but pride and anger both failed when she
      considered the situation of his health; sorrow, there, took the lead, and
      admitted no partner; it represented him to her not only as lost to
      herself, but to the world; and so sad grew her reflections, and so heavy
      her heart, that, to avoid from Mrs Charlton observations which pained her,
      she stole into a summer-house in the garden the moment she had done tea,
      declining any companion but her affectionate Fidel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tenderness and her sorrow found here a romantic consolation, in
      complaining to him of the absence of his master, his voluntary exile, and
      her fears for his health; calling upon him to participate in her sorrow,
      and lamenting that even this little relief would soon be denied her; and
      that in losing Fidel no vestige of Mortimer, but in her own breast, would
      remain; &ldquo;Go, then, dear Fidel,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;carry back to your master all
      that nourishes his remembrance! Bid him not love you the less for having
      some time belonged to Cecilia; but never may his proud heart be fed with
      the vain glory of knowing how fondly for his sake she has cherished you!
      Go, dear Fidel, guard him by night, and follow him by day; serve him with
      zeal, and love him with fidelity;&mdash;oh that his health were invincible
      as his pride!&mdash;there, alone, is he vulnerable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Fidel, with a loud barking, suddenly sprang away from her, and, as
      she turned her eyes towards the door to see what had thus startled him,
      she beheld standing there, as if immoveable, young Delvile himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her astonishment at this sight almost bereft her of her understanding; it
      appeared to her supernatural, and she rather believed it was his ghost
      than himself. Fixed in mute wonder, she stood still though terrified, her
      eyes almost bursting from their sockets to be satisfied if what they saw
      was real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, too, was some time speechless; he looked not at her, indeed, with
      any doubt of her existence, but as if what he had heard was to him as
      amazing as to her what she saw. At length, however, tormented by the dog,
      who jumpt up to him, licked his hands, and by his rapturous joy forced
      himself into notice, he was moved to return his caresses, saying, &ldquo;Yes, <i>dear
      Fidel!</i> you have a claim indeed to my attention, and with the fondest
      gratitude will I cherish you ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice, Cecilia again began to breathe; and Delvile
      having quieted the dog, now entered the summer-house, saying, as he
      advanced, &ldquo;Is this possible!&mdash;am I not in a dream?&mdash;Good God! is
      it indeed possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consternation of doubt and astonishment which had seized every faculty
      of Cecilia, now changed into certainty that Delvile indeed was present,
      all her recollection returned as she listened, to this question, and the
      wild rambling of fancy with which she had incautiously indulged her
      sorrow, rushing suddenly upon her mind, she felt herself wholly
      overpowered by consciousness and shame, and sunk, almost fainting, upon a
      window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile instantly flew to her, penetrated with gratitude, and filled with
      wonder and delight, which, however internally combated by sensations less
      pleasant, were too potent for controul, and he poured forth at her feet
      the most passionate acknowledgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, surprised, affected, and trembling with a thousand emotions,
      endeavoured to break from him and rise; but, eagerly detaining her, &ldquo;No,
      loveliest Miss Beverley,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;not thus must we now part! this
      moment only have I discovered what a treasure I was leaving; and, but for
      Fidel, I had quitted it in ignorance for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, in the extremest agitation, &ldquo;indeed you may
      believe me Fidel is here quite by accident.&mdash;Lady Honoria took him
      away,&mdash;I knew nothing of the matter,&mdash;she stole him, she sent
      him, she did every thing herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O kind Lady Honoria!&rdquo; cried Delvile, more and more delighted, &ldquo;how shall
      I ever thank her!&mdash;And did she also tell you to caress and to cherish
      him?&mdash;to talk to him of his master&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O heaven!&rdquo; interrupted Cecilia, in an agony of mortification and shame,
      &ldquo;to what has my unguarded folly reduced me!&rdquo; Then again endeavouring to
      break from him, &ldquo;Leave me, Mr Delvile,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;leave me, or let me
      pass!&mdash;never can I see you more!&mdash;never bear you again in my
      sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, <i>dear Fidel!</i>&rdquo; cried he, still detaining her, &ldquo;come and plead
      for your master! come and ask in his name who <i>now</i> has a proud
      heart, whose pride <i>now</i> is invincible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh go!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, looking away from him while she spoke, &ldquo;repeat not
      those hateful words, if you wish me not to detest myself eternally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever-lovely Miss Beverley,&rdquo; cried he, more seriously, &ldquo;why this
      resentment? why all this causeless distress? Has not <i>my</i> heart long
      since been known to you? have you not witnessed its sufferings, and been
      assured of its tenderness? why, then, this untimely reserve? this
      unabating coldness? Oh why try to rob me of the felicity you have
      inadvertently given me! and to sour the happiness of a moment that
      recompenses such exquisite misery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Mr Delvile!&rdquo; cried she, impatiently, though half softened, &ldquo;was this
      honourable or right? to steal upon me thus privately&mdash;to listen to me
      thus secretly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You blame me,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;too soon; your own friend, Mrs Charlton,
      permitted me to come hither in search of you;&mdash;then, indeed, when I
      heard the sound of your voice&mdash;when I heard that voice talk of <i>Fidel</i>&mdash;of
      his <i>master</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh stop, stop!&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;I cannot support the recollection! there is
      no punishment, indeed, which my own indiscretion does not merit,&mdash;but
      I shall have sufficient in the bitterness of self-reproach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will you talk thus, my beloved Miss Beverley? what have you done,&mdash;what,
      let me ask, have <i>I</i> done, that such infinite disgrace and depression
      should follow this little sensibility to a passion so fervent? Does it not
      render you more dear to me than ever? does it not add new life, new
      vigour, to the devotion by which I am bound to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the mortified Cecilia, who from the moment she found
      herself betrayed, believed herself to be lost, &ldquo;far other is the effect it
      will have! and the same mad folly by which I am ruined in my own esteem,
      will ruin me in yours!&mdash;I cannot endure to think of it!&mdash;why
      will you persist in detaining me?&mdash;You have filled me with anguish
      and mortification,&mdash;you have taught me the bitterest of lessons, that
      of hating and contemning myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven,&rdquo; cried he, much hurt, &ldquo;what strange apprehensions thus
      terrify you? are you with me less safe than with yourself? is it my honour
      you doubt? is it my integrity you fear? Surely I cannot be so little known
      to you; and to make protestations now, would but give a new alarm to a
      delicacy already too agitated.&mdash;Else would I tell you that more
      sacred than my life will I hold what I have heard, that the words just now
      graven on my heart, shall remain there to eternity unseen; and that higher
      than ever, not only in my love, but my esteem, is the beautiful speaker.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah no!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with a sigh, &ldquo;that, at least, is impossible, for
      lower than ever is she sunk from deserving it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried he, with fervour, &ldquo;she is raised, she is exalted! I find her
      more excellent and perfect than I had even dared believe her; I discover
      new virtues in the spring of every action; I see what I took for
      indifference, was dignity; I perceive what I imagined the most rigid
      insensibility, was nobleness, was propriety, was true greatness of mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was somewhat appeased by this speech; and, after a little
      hesitation, she said, with a half smile, &ldquo;Must I thank you for this
      good-nature in seeking to reconcile me with myself?&mdash;or shall I
      quarrel with you for flattery, in giving me praise you can so little think
      I merit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;were I to praise as I think of you! were my language
      permitted to accord with my opinion of your worth, you would not then
      simply call me a flatterer, you would tell me I was an idolater, and fear
      at least for my principles, if not for my understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have but little right, however,&rdquo; said Cecilia, again rising, &ldquo;to
      arraign your understanding while I act as if bereft of my own. Now, at
      least, let me pass; indeed you will greatly displease me by any further
      opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you suffer me, then, to see you early to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir; nor the next morning, nor the morning after that! This meeting
      has been wrong, another would be worse; in this I have accusation enough
      for folly,&mdash;in another the charge would be far more heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Miss Beverley, then,&rdquo; cried he gravely, &ldquo;think me capable of
      desiring to see her for mere selfish gratification? of intending to trifle
      either with her time or her feelings? no; the conference I desire will be
      important and decisive. This night I shall devote solely to deliberation;
      to-morrow shall be given to action. Without some thinking I dare venture
      at no plan;&mdash;I presume not to communicate to you the various
      interests that divide me, but the result of them all I can take no denial
      to your hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who felt when thus stated the justice of his request, now opposed
      it no longer, but insisted upon his instantly departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I must go!&mdash;the longer I stay, the more I am
      fascinated, and the weaker are those reasoning powers of which I now want
      the strongest exertion.&rdquo; He then repeated his professions of eternal
      regard, besought her not to regret the happiness she had given him, and
      after disobeying her injunctions of going till she was seriously
      displeased, he only stayed to obtain her pardon, and permission to be
      early the next morning, and then, though still slowly and reluctantly, he
      left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce was Cecilia again alone, but the whole of what had passed seemed a
      vision of her imagination. That Delvile should be at Bury, that he should
      visit her at Mrs Charlton's, surprise her by herself, and discover her
      most secret thoughts, appeared so strange and so incredible, that,
      occupied rather by wonder than, thinking, she continued almost motionless
      in the place where he had left her, till Mrs Charlton sent to request that
      she would return to the house. She then enquired if any body was with her,
      and being answered in the negative, obeyed the summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton, with a smile of much meaning, hoped she had had a pleasant
      walk; but Cecilia seriously remonstrated on the dangerous imprudence she
      had committed in suffering her to be so unguardedly surprised. Mrs
      Charlton, however, more anxious for her future and solid happiness, than
      for her present apprehensions and delicacy, repented not the step she had
      taken; and when she gathered from Cecilia the substance of what had past,
      unmindful of the expostulations which accompanied it, she thought with
      exultation that the sudden meeting she had permitted, would now, by making
      known to each their mutual affection, determine them to defer no longer a
      union upon which their mutual peace of mind so much depended. And Cecilia,
      finding she had been thus betrayed designedly, not inadvertently, could
      hardly reproach her zeal, though she lamented its indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then asked by what means he had obtained admission, and made himself
      known; and heard that he had enquired at the door for Miss Beverley, and,
      having sent in his name, was shewn into the parlour, where Mrs Charlton,
      much pleased with his appearance, had suddenly conceived the little plan
      which she had executed, of contriving a surprise for Cecilia, from which
      she rationally expected the very consequences that ensued, though the
      immediate means she had not conjectured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account was still unsatisfactory to Cecilia, who could frame to
      herself no possible reason for a visit so extraordinary, and so totally
      inconsistent with his declarations and resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was a matter of but little moment, compared with the other
      subjects to which the interview had given rise; Delvile, upon whom so
      long, though secretly, her dearest hopes of happiness had rested, was now
      become acquainted with his power, and knew himself the master of her
      destiny; he had quitted her avowedly to decide what it should be, since
      his present subject of deliberation included her fate in his own; the next
      morning he was to call, and acquaint her with his decree, not doubting her
      concurrence which ever way be resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subjection so undue, and which she could not but consider as
      disgraceful, both shocked and afflicted her; and the reflection that the
      man who of all men she preferred, was acquainted with her preference, yet
      hesitated whether to accept or abandon her, mortified and provoked her,
      alternately, occupied her thoughts the whole night, and kept her from
      peace and from rest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER iv. &mdash; A PROPOSITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning, Delvile again made his appearance. Cecilia, who
      was at breakfast with Mrs and Miss Charltons, received him with the most
      painful confusion, and he was evidently himself in a state of the utmost
      perturbation. Mrs Charlton made a pretence almost immediately for sending
      away both her grand-daughters, and then, without taking the trouble of
      devising one for herself, arose and followed them, though Cecilia made
      sundry signs of solicitation that she would stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding herself now alone with him, she hastily, and without knowing what
      she said, cried, &ldquo;How is Mrs Delvile, Sir? Is she still at Bristol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Bristol? no; have you never heard she is returned to Delvile Castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, true!&mdash;I meant Delvile Castle,&mdash;but I hope she found some
      benefit from the waters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had not, I believe, any occasion to try them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, ashamed of these two following mistakes, coloured high; but
      ventured not again to speak; and Delvile, who seemed big with something he
      feared to utter, arose, and walked for a few instants about the room;
      after which, exclaiming aloud &ldquo;How vain is every plan which passes the
      present hour!&rdquo; He advanced to Cecilia, who pretended to be looking at some
      work, and seating himself next her, &ldquo;when we parted yesterday,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;I presumed to say one night alone should be given to deliberation,&mdash;and
      to-day, this very day to action!&mdash;but I forgot that though in
      deliberating I had only myself to consult, in acting I was not so
      independent; and that when my own doubts were satisfied, and my own
      resolutions taken, other doubts and other resolutions must be considered,
      by which my purposed proceedings might be retarded, might perhaps be
      wholly prevented!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but Cecilia, unable to conjecture to what he was leading, made
      not any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon you, madam,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;all that is good or evil of my future
      life, as far as relates to its happiness or misery, will, from this very
      hour, almost solely depend; yet much as I rely upon your goodness, and
      superior as I know you to trifling or affectation, what I now come to
      propose&mdash;to petition&mdash;to entreat&mdash;I cannot summon courage
      to mention, from a dread of alarming you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What next, thought Cecilia, trembling at this introduction, is preparing
      for me! does he mean to ask <i>me</i> to solicit Mrs Delvile's consent! or
      from myself must he receive commands that we should never meet more!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Beverley,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;determined not to, speak to me? Is she bent
      upon silence only to intimidate me? Indeed if she knew how greatly I
      respect her, she would honour me with more confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, Sir,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;do you mean to make your tour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried he, with fervour, &ldquo;unless banished by <i>you</i>, never!&mdash;no,
      loveliest Miss Beverley, I can now quit you no more! Fortune, beauty,
      worth and sweetness I had power to relinquish, and severe as was the task,
      I compelled myself to perform it,&mdash;but when to these I find joined so
      attractive a softness,&mdash;a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedly
      gentle no! sweetest Miss Beverley, I can quit you no more!&rdquo; And then,
      seizing her hand, with yet greater energy, he went on, &ldquo;I here,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;offer you my vows, I here own you sole arbitress of my fate! I give you
      not merely the possession of my heart,&mdash;that, indeed, I had no power
      to withhold from you,&mdash;but I give you the direction of my conduct, I
      entreat you to become my counsellor and guide. Will Miss Beverley accept
      such an office? Will she deign to listen to such a prayer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, involuntarily delighted to find that such was the
      result of his night's deliberation, &ldquo;I am most ready to give you my
      counsel; which I now do,&mdash;that you set off for the Continent
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O how malicious!&rdquo; cried he, half laughing, &ldquo;yet not so immediately do I
      even request your counsel; something must first be done to qualify you for
      giving it; penetration, skill and understanding, however amply you possess
      them, are not sufficient to fit you for the charge; something still more
      is requisite, you must be invested with fuller powers, you must have a
      right less disputable, and a title, that not alone, inclination, not even
      judgment alone must sanctify, but which law must enforce, and rites the
      most solemn support!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, then,&rdquo; said Cecilia, deeply blushing, &ldquo;I must be content to
      forbear giving any counsel at all, if the qualifications for it are so
      difficult of acquirement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resent not my presumption,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;my beloved Miss Beverley, but let
      the severity of my recent sufferings palliate my present temerity; for
      where affliction has been deep and serious, causeless and unnecessary
      misery will find little encouragement; and mine has been serious indeed!
      Sweetly, then, permit me, in proportion to its bitterness, to rejoice in
      the soft reverse which now flatters me with its approach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, abashed and uneasy, uncertain of what was to follow, and
      unwilling to speak till more assured, paused, and then abruptly exclaimed
      &ldquo;I am afraid Mrs Charlton is waiting for me,&rdquo; and would have hurried away;
      but Delvile, almost forcibly preventing her, compelled her to stay; and,
      after a short conversation, on his side the most impassioned, and on hers
      the most confused, obtained from her, what, indeed, after the surprise of
      the preceding evening she could but ill deny, a frank confirmation of his
      power over her heart, and an ingenuous, though reluctant acknowledgment,
      how long he had possessed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confession, made, as affairs now stood, wholly in opposition to her
      judgment, was torn from her by an impetuous urgency which she had not
      presence of mind to resist, and with which Delvile, when particularly
      animated, had long been accustomed to overpower all opposition. The joy
      with which he heard it, though but little mixed with wonder, was as
      violent as the eagerness with which he had sought it; yet it was not of
      long duration, a sudden, and most painful recollection presently quelled
      it, and even in the midst of his rapturous acknowledgment, seemed to
      strike him to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, soon perceiving both in his countenance and manner an alteration
      that shocked her, bitterly repented an avowal she could never recall, and
      looked aghast with expectation and dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, who with quickness saw a change of expression in her of which in
      himself he was unconscious, exclaimed, with much emotion, &ldquo;O how transient
      is human felicity! How rapidly fly those rare and exquisite moments in
      which it is perfect! Ah! sweetest Miss Beverley, what words shall I find
      to soften what I have now to reveal! to tell you that, after goodness,
      candour, generosity such as yours, a request, a supplication remains yet
      to be uttered that banishes me, if refused, from your presence for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, extremely dismayed, desired to know what it was; an evident dread
      of offending her kept him some time from proceeding, but at length, after
      repeatedly expressing his fears of her disapprobation, and a repugnance
      even on his own part to the very measure he was obliged to urge, he
      acknowledged that all his hopes of being ever united to her, rested upon
      obtaining her consent to an immediate and secret marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, thunderstruck by this declaration, remained for a few instants
      too much confounded to speak; but when he was beginning an explanatory
      apology, she started up, and glowing with indignation, said, &ldquo;I had
      flattered myself, Sir, that both my character and my conduct, independent
      of my situation in life, would have exempted me at all times from a
      proposal which I shall ever think myself degraded by having heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she was again going, but Delvile still preventing her, said &ldquo;I
      knew too well how much you would be alarmed, and such was my dread of your
      displeasure that it had power even to embitter the happiness I sought with
      so much earnestness, and to render your condescension insufficient to
      ensure it. Yet wonder not at my scheme; wild as it may appear, it is the
      result of deliberation, and censurable as it may seem, it springs not from
      unworthy motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever may be your motives with respect to yourself, Sir,&rdquo; said
      Cecilia, &ldquo;with respect to me they must certainly be disgraceful; I will
      not, therefore, listen to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrong me cruelly,&rdquo; cried he, with warmth, &ldquo;and a moment's reflection
      must tell you that however distinct may be our honour or our disgrace in
      every other instance, in that by which we should be united, they must
      inevitably be the same; and far sooner would I voluntarily relinquish you,
      than be myself accessory to tainting that delicacy of which the unsullied
      purity has been the chief source of my admiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, reproachfully, &ldquo;have you mentioned to me such
      a project?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances the most singular, and necessity the most unavoidable,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;should alone have ever tempted me to form it. No longer ago
      than yesterday morning, I believed myself incapable of even wishing it;
      but extraordinary situations call for extraordinary resolutions, and in
      private as well as public life, palliate, at least, extraordinary actions.
      Alas! the proposal which so much offends you is my final resource! it is
      the sole barrier between myself and perpetual misery!&mdash;the only
      expedient in my power to save me from eternally parting from you!&mdash;for
      I am compelled now cruelly to confess, that my family, I am certain, will
      never consent to our union!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, then, Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with great spirit, &ldquo;will I! The
      disdain I may meet with I pretend not to retort, but wilfully to
      encounter, were meanly to deserve it. I will enter into no family in
      opposition to its wishes, I will consent to no alliance that may expose me
      to indignity. Nothing is so contagious as contempt!&mdash;The example of
      your friends might work powerfully upon yourself, and who shall dare
      assure me you would not catch the infection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> dare assure you!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;hasty you may perhaps think me, and
      somewhat impetuous I cannot deny myself; but believe me not of so wretched
      a character as to be capable, in any affair of moment, of fickleness or
      caprice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what, Sir, is my security to the contrary? Have you not this moment
      avowed that but yesterday you held in abhorrence the very plan that to-day
      you propose? And may you not to-morrow resume again the same opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel Miss Beverley! how unjust is this inference! If yesterday I
      disapproved what to-day I recommend, a little recollection must surely
      tell you why; and that not my opinion, but my situation is changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conscious Cecilia here turned away her head; too certain he alluded to
      the discovery of her partiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not yourself,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;witnessed the steadiness of my
      mind? Have you not beheld me fly, when I had power to pursue, and avoid,
      when I had opportunity to seek you? After witnessing my constancy upon
      such trying occasions, is it equitable, is it right to suspect me of
      wavering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;was the constancy which brought you into Suffolk?&mdash;When
      all occasion was over for our meeting any more, when you told me you were
      going abroad, and took leave of me for ever,&mdash;where, then, was your
      steadiness in this unnecessary journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care,&rdquo; cried he, half smiling, and taking a letter from his
      pocket, &ldquo;have a care, upon this point, how you provoke me to spew my
      justification!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, blushing, &ldquo;'tis some trick of Lady Honoria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, upon my honour. The authority is less doubtful; I believe I should
      hardly else have regarded it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, much alarmed, held out her hand for the letter; and looking first
      at the end was much astonished to see the name of Biddulph. She then cast
      her eye over the beginning, and when she saw her own name, read the
      following paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley, as you doubtless know, is returned into Suffolk; every
      body here saw her with the utmost surprize; from the moment I had heard of
      her residence in Delvile Castle, I had given her up for lost; but, upon
      her unexpected appearance among us again, I was weak enough once more to
      make trial of her heart. I soon found, however, that the pain of a second
      rejection <i>you</i> might have spared me, and that though she had quitted
      Delvile Castle, she had not for nothing entered it; at the sound of your
      name, she blushes; at the mention of your illness, she turns pale; and the
      dog you have given her, which I recollected immediately, is her darling
      companion. Oh happy Delvile! yet so lovely a conquest you abandon.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia could read no more; the letter dropt from her hand; to find
      herself thus by her own emotions betrayed, made her instantly conclude she
      was universally discovered; and turning sick at the supposition, all her
      spirit forsook her, and she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven,&rdquo; cried Delvile, extremely shocked, &ldquo;what has thus affected
      you? Can the jealous surmises of an apprehensive rival&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not talk to me,&rdquo; interrupted she, impatiently, &ldquo;and do not detain me,&mdash;I
      am extremely disturbed,&mdash;I wish to be alone,&mdash;I beg, I even
      entreat you would leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go, I will obey you in every thing!&rdquo; cried he, eagerly, &ldquo;tell me
      but when I may return, and when you will suffer me to explain to you all
      the motives of my proposal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; cried she, with earnestness, &ldquo;I am sufficiently lowered
      already, but never will I intrude myself into a family that disdains me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disdains? No, you are revered in it! who could disdain you! That fatal
      clause alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, pray leave me; indeed I cannot hear you; I am unfit for
      argument, and all reasoning now is nothing less than cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am gone,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;this moment! I would not even wish to take
      advantage of your agitation in order to work upon your sensibility. My
      desire is not to surprize, but to reconcile you to my plan. What is it I
      seek in Miss Beverley? An Heiress? No, as such she has seen I could resist
      her; nor yet the light trifler of a spring or two, neglected when no
      longer a novelty; no, no!&mdash;it is a companion for ever, it is a solace
      for every care, it is a bosom friend through every period of life that I
      seek in Miss Beverley! Her esteem, therefore, to me is as precious as her
      affection, for how can I hope her friendship in the winter of my days, if
      their brighter and gayer season is darkened by doubts of my integrity? All
      shall be clear and explicit; no latent cause of uneasiness shall disturb
      our future quiet; we will now be sincere, that hereafter we may be easy;
      and sweetly in unclouded felicity, time shall glide away imperceptibly,
      and we will make an interest with each other in the gaiety of youth, to
      bear with the infirmities of age, and alleviate them by kindness and
      sympathy. And then shall my soothing Cecilia&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O say no more!&rdquo; interrupted she, softened in her own despite by a plan so
      consonant to her wishes, &ldquo;what language is this! how improper for you to
      use, or me to hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then very earnestly insisted upon his going; and after a thousand
      times taking leave and returning, promising obedience, yet pursuing his
      own way, he at length said if she would consent to receive a letter from
      him, he would endeavour to commit what he had to communicate to paper,
      since their mutual agitation made him unable to explain himself with
      clearness, and rather hurt his cause than assisted it, by leaving all his
      arguments unfinished and obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another dispute now arose; Cecilia protesting she would receive no letter,
      and hear nothing upon the subject; and Delvile impetuously declaring he
      would submit to no award without being first heard. At length he
      conquered, and at length he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia then felt her whole heart sink within her at the unhappiness of
      her situation. She considered herself now condemned to refuse Delvile
      herself, as the only condition upon which he even solicited her favour,
      neither the strictness of her principles, nor the delicacy of her mind,
      would suffer her to accept. Her displeasure at the proposal had been
      wholly unaffected, and she regarded it as an injury to her character ever
      to have received it; yet that Delvile's pride of heart should give way to
      his passion, that he should love her with so much fondness as to
      relinquish for her the ambitious schemes of his family, and even that
      darling name which so lately seemed annexed to his existence, were
      circumstances to which she was not insensible, and proofs of tenderness
      and regard which she had thought incompatible with the general spirit of
      his disposition. Yet however by these she was gratified, she resolved
      never to comply with so humiliating a measure, but to wait the consent of
      his friends, or renounce him for ever.

      CHAPTER v. &mdash; A LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as Mrs Charlton was acquainted with the departure of young
      Delvile, she returned to Cecilia, impatient to be informed what had
      passed. The narration she heard both hurt and astonished her; that
      Cecilia, the Heiress of such a fortune, the possessor of so much beauty,
      descended of a worthy family, and formed and educated to grace a noble
      one, should be rejected by people to whom her wealth would be most useful,
      and only in secret have their alliance proposed to her, she deemed an
      indignity that called for nothing but resentment, and approved and
      enforced the resolution of her young friend to resist all solicitations
      which Mr and Mrs Delvile did not second themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      About, two hours after Delvile was gone, his letter arrived. Cecilia
      opened it with trepidation, and read as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Miss Beverley. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      September 20, 1779.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be the apprehensions, the suspicions of Miss Beverley when so
      earnestly she prohibited my writing? From a temper so unguarded as mine
      could she fear any subtlety of doctrine? Is my character so little known
      to her that she can think me capable of craft or duplicity? Had I even the
      desire, I have neither the address nor the patience to practice them; no,
      loveliest Miss Beverley, though sometimes by vehemence I may incautiously
      offend, by sophistry, believe me, I never shall injure; my ambition, as I
      have told you, is to convince, not beguile, and my arguments shall be
      simple as my professions shall be sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet how again may I venture to mention a proposal which so lately almost
      before you had heard you rejected? Suffer me, however, to assure you it
      resulted neither from insensibility to your delicacy, nor to my own duty;
      I made it, on the contrary, with that reluctance and timidity which were
      given me by an apprehension that both seemed to be offended by it;&mdash;but
      alas! already I have said what with grief I must repeat, I have no
      resource, no alternative, between receiving the honour of your hand in
      secret or foregoing you for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will wonder, you may well wonder at such a declaration; and again that
      severe renunciation with which you wounded me, will tremble on your lips,&mdash;Oh
      there let it stop! nor let the air again be agitated with sounds so
      discordant!
    </p>
    <p>
      In that cruel and heart-breaking moment when I tore myself from you at
      Delvile Castle, I confessed to you the reason of my flight, and I
      determined to see you no more. I named not to you, then, my family, the
      potency of my own objections against daring to solicit your favour
      rendering theirs immaterial; my own are now wholly removed, but theirs
      remain in full force.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is
      unsubdued in pride, considers himself as the guardian of the honour of his
      house, to which he holds the name of his ancestors inseparably annexed; my
      mother, born of the same family, and bred to the same ideas, has
      strengthened this opinion by giving it the sanction of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being their sentiments; you will not, madam, be surprised that their
      only son, the sole inheritor of their fortune, and sole object of their
      expectations, should early have admitted the same. Indeed almost the first
      lesson I was taught was that of reverencing the family from which I am
      descended, and the name to which I am born. I was bid consider myself as
      its only remaining support, and sedulously instructed neither to act nor
      think but with a view to its aggrandizement and dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, unchecked by ourselves, and uncontrouled by the world, this haughty
      self-importance acquired by time a strength, and by mutual encouragement a
      firmness, which Miss Beverley alone could possibly, I believe, have
      shaken! What, therefore, was my secret alarm, when first I was conscious
      of the force of her attractions, and found my mind wholly occupied with
      admiration of her excellencies! All that pride could demand, and all to
      which ambition could aspire, all that happiness could covet, or the most
      scrupulous delicacy exact, in her I found united; and while my heart was
      enslaved by her charms, my understanding exulted in its fetters. Yet to
      forfeit my name, to give up for-ever a family which upon me rested its
      latest expectations,&mdash;Honour, I thought forbad it, propriety and
      manly spirit revolted at the sacrifice. The renunciation of my birth-right
      seemed a desertion of the post in which I was stationed; I forbore,
      therefore, even in my wishes, to solicit your favour, and vigorously
      determined to fly you as dangerous to my peace, because unattainable
      without dishonour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the intended regulation of my conduct at the time I received
      Biddulph's letter; in three days I was to leave England; my father, with
      much persuasion, had consented to my departure; my mother, who penetrated
      into my motives, had never opposed it; but how great was the change
      wrought upon my mind by reading that letter! my steadiness forsook me, my
      resolution wavered; yet I thought him deceived, and attributed his
      suspicions to jealousy; but still, Fidel I knew was missing&mdash;and to
      hear he was your darling companion&mdash;was it possible to quit England
      in a state of such uncertainty? to be harassed in distant climates with
      conjectures I might then never satisfy? No; I told my friends I must visit
      Biddulph before I left the kingdom, and promising to return to them in
      three or four days, I hastily set out for Suffolk, and rested not till I
      arrived at Mrs Charlton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a scene there awaited me! to behold the loved mistress of my heart,
      the opposed, yet resistless object of my fondest admiration, caressing an
      animal she knew to be mine, mourning over him his master's ill health, and
      sweetly recommending to him fidelity,&mdash;Ah! forgive the retrospection,
      I will dwell on it no longer. Little, indeed, had I imagined with what
      softness the dignity of Miss Beverley was blended, though always conscious
      that her virtues, her attractions, and her excellencies, would reflect
      lustre upon the highest station to which human grandeur could raise her,
      and would still be more exalted than her rank, though that were the most
      eminent upon earth.&mdash;And had there been a thousand, and ten thousand
      obstacles to oppose my addressing her, vigorously and undauntedly would I
      have combated with them all, in preference to yielding to this single
      objection!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let not the frankness of this declaration irritate you, but rather let it
      serve to convince you of the sincerity of what follows; various as are the
      calamities of life which may render me miserable, YOU only, among even its
      chosen felicities, have power to make me happy. Fame, honours, wealth,
      ambition, were insufficient without you; all chance of internal peace, and
      every softer hope is now centered in your favour, and to lose you, from
      whatever cause, ensures me wretchedness unmitigated. With respect
      therefore to myself, the die is finally cast, and the conflict between
      bosom felicity and family pride is deliberately over. This name which so
      vainly I have cherished and so painfully supported, I now find inadequate
      to recompense me for the sacrifice which its preservation requires. I part
      with it, I own, with regret that the surrender is necessary; yet is it
      rather an imaginary than an actual evil, and though a deep wound to pride,
      no offence to morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart, confessed my perplexities,
      acknowledged my vain-glory, and exposed with equal sincerity the sources
      of my doubts, and the motives of my decision; but now, indeed, how to
      proceed I know not; the difficulties which are yet to encounter I fear to
      enumerate, and the petition I have to urge I have scarce courage to
      mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity, have long
      planned a splendid connection for me, to which though my invariable
      repugnance has stopt any advances, their wishes and their views immovably
      adhere. I am but too certain they will now listen to no other. I dread,
      therefore, to make a trial where I despair of success, I know not how to
      risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a command.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a situation so desperate, what then remains? Must I make an application
      with a certainty of rejection, and then mock all authority by acting in
      defiance of it? Or, harder task yet! relinquish my dearest hopes when no
      longer persuaded of their impropriety? Ah! sweetest Miss Beverley, end the
      struggle at once! My happiness, my peace, are wholly in your power, for
      the moment of our union secures them for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem to you strange that I should thus purpose to brave the friends
      whom I venture not to entreat; but from my knowledge of their characters
      and sentiments I am certain I have no other resource. Their favourite
      principles were too early imbibed to be now at this late season
      eradicated. Slaves that we all are to habits, and dupes to appearances,
      jealous guardians of our pride, to which our comfort is sacrificed, and
      even our virtue made subservient, what conviction can be offered by
      reason, to notions that exist but by prejudice? They have been cherished
      too long for rhetorick to remove them, they can only be expelled by
      all-powerful Necessity. Life is, indeed, too brief, and success too
      precarious, to trust, in any case where happiness is concerned, the
      extirpation of deep-rooted and darling opinions, to the slow-working
      influence of argument and disquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet bigotted as they are to rank and family, they adore Miss Beverley, and
      though their consent to the forfeiture of their name might forever be
      denied, when once they beheld her the head and ornament of their house,
      her elegance and accomplishments joined to the splendour of her fortune,
      would speedily make them forget the plans which now wholly absorb them.
      Their sense of honour is in nothing inferior to their sense of high birth;
      your condescension, therefore, would be felt by them in its fullest force,
      and though, during their first surprize, they might be irritated against
      their son, they would make it the study of their lives that the lady who
      for him had done so much, should never, through their means, repine for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to settlements, the privacy of our union would not affect
      them; one Confident we must unavoidably trust, and I would deposit in the
      hands of whatever person you would name, a bond by which I would engage
      myself to settle both your fortune and my own, according to the
      arbitration of our mutual friends. The time for secrecy though painful
      would be short, and even from the altar, if you desired it, I would hasten
      to Delvile Castle. Not one of my friends should you see till they waited
      upon you themselves to solicit your presence at their house, till our
      residence elsewhere was fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh loveliest Cecilia, from a dream Of happiness so sweet awaken me not!
      from a plan Of felicity so attractive turn not away! If one part of it is
      unpleasant, reject not therefore all; and since without some drawback no
      earthly bliss is attainable, do not, by a refinement too scrupulous for
      the short period of our existence, deny yourself that delight which your
      benevolence will afford you, in snatching from the pangs of unavailing
      regret and misery, the gratefullest of men in the humblest and most
      devoted of your servants, MORTIMER DELVILE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia read and re-read this letter, but with a perturbation of mind that
      made her little able to weigh its contents. Paragraph by paragraph her
      sentiments varied, and her determination was changed; the earnestness of
      his supplication now softened her into compliance, the acknowledged pride
      of his family now irritated her into resentment, and the confession of his
      own regret now sickened her into despondence. She meant in an immediate
      answer, to have written a final dismission; but though proof against his
      entreaties, because not convinced by his arguments, there was something in
      the conclusion of his letter that staggered her resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those scruples and that refinement against which he warned her, she
      herself thought might be overstrained, and to gratify unnecessary
      punctilio, the short period of existence be rendered causelessly unhappy.
      He had truly said that their union would be no offence to morality, and
      with respect merely to pride, why should that be spared? He knew he
      possessed her heart, she had long been certain of his, her character had
      early gained the affection of his mother, and the essential service which
      an income such as hers must do the family, would soon be felt too
      powerfully to make her connection with it regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections were so pleasant she knew not how to discard them; and
      the consciousness that her secret was betrayed not only to himself, but to
      Mr Biddulph, Lord Ernolf, Lady Honoria Pemberton, and Mrs Delvile, gave
      them additional force, by making it probable she was yet more widely
      suspected. But still her delicacy and her principles revolted against a
      conduct of which the secrecy seemed to imply the impropriety. &ldquo;How shall I
      meet Mrs Delvile,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;after an action so clandestine? How, after
      praise such as she has bestowed upon me, bear the severity of her eye,
      when she thinks I have seduced from her the obedience of her son! A son
      who is the sole solace and first hope of her existence, whose virtues make
      all her happiness, and whose filial piety is her only glory!&mdash;And
      well may she glory in a son such as Delvile! Nobly has he exerted himself
      in situations the most difficult, his family and his ideas of honour he
      has preferred to his peace and health, he has fulfilled with spirit and
      integrity the various, the conflicting duties of life. Even now, perhaps,
      in his present application, he may merely think himself bound by knowing
      me no longer free, and his generous sensibility to the weakness he has
      discovered, without any of the conviction to which he pretends, may have
      occasioned this proposal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A suggestion so mortifying again changed her determination; and the tears
      of Henrietta Belfield, with the letter which she had surprized in her hand
      recurring to her memory, all her thoughts turned once more upon rejecting
      him for-ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this fluctuating state of mind she found writing impracticable; while
      uncertain what to wish, to decide was impossible. She disdained coquetry,
      she was superior to trifling, the candour and openness of Delvile had
      merited all her sincerity, and therefore while any doubt remained, with
      herself, she held it unworthy her character to tell him she had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton, upon reading the letter, became again the advocate of
      Delvile; the frankness with which he had stated his difficulties assured
      her of his probity, and by explaining his former conduct, satisfied her
      with the rectitude of his future intentions. &ldquo;Do not, therefore, my dear
      child,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;become the parent of your own misery by refusing him;
      he deserves you alike from his principles and his affection, and the task
      would both be long and melancholy to disengage him from your heart. I see
      not, however, the least occasion for the disgrace of a private marriage; I
      know not any family to which you would not be an honour, and those who
      feel not your merit, are little worth pleasing. Let Mr Delvile, therefore,
      apply openly to his friends, and if they refuse their consent, be their
      prejudices their reward. You are freed from all obligations where caprice
      only can raise objections, and you may then, in the face of the world,
      vindicate your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wishes of Cecilia accorded with this advice, though the general tenour
      of Delvile's letter gave her little reason to expect he would follow it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER vi. &mdash; A DISCUSSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day past away, and Cecilia had yet written no answer; the evening
      came, and her resolution was still unfixed. Delvile, at length, was again
      announced; and though she dreaded trusting herself to his entreaties, the
      necessity of hastening some decision deterred her from refusing to see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton was with her when he entered the room; he attempted at first
      some general conversation, though the anxiety of his mind was strongly
      pictured upon his face. Cecilia endeavoured also to talk upon common
      topics, though her evident embarrassment spoke the absence of her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile at length, unable any longer to bear suspence, turned to Mrs
      Charlton, and said, &ldquo;You are probably acquainted, madam, with the purport
      of the letter I had the honour of sending to Miss Beverley this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; answered the old lady, &ldquo;and you need desire little more than
      that her opinion of it may be as favourable as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delvile bowed and thanked her; and looking at Cecilia, to whom he ventured
      not to speak, he perceived in her countenance a mixture of dejection and
      confusion, that told him whatever might be her opinion, it had by no means
      encreased her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Sir,&rdquo; said Mrs Charlton, &ldquo;should you be thus sure of the
      disapprobation of your friends? had you not better hear what they have to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>know</i>, madam, what they have to say,&rdquo; returned he; &ldquo;for their
      language and their principles have been invariable from my birth; to apply
      to them, therefore, for a concession which I am certain they will not
      grant, were only a cruel device to lay all my misery to their account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they are so perverse, they deserve from you nothing better,&rdquo; said
      Mrs Charlton; &ldquo;speak to them, however; you will then have done your duty;
      and if they are obstinately unjust, you will have acquired a right to act
      for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To mock their authority,&rdquo; answered Delvile, &ldquo;would be more offensive than
      to oppose it; to solicit their approbation, and then act in defiance of
      it, might justly provoke their indignation.&mdash;No; if at last I am
      reduced to appeal to them, by their decision I must abide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Mrs Charlton could make no answer, and in a few minutes she left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is such, also,&rdquo; said Delvile, &ldquo;the opinion of Miss Beverley? has she
      doomed me to be wretched, and does she wish that doom to be signed by my
      nearest friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your friends, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;are so undoubtedly inflexible, it
      were madness, upon any plan, to risk their displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To entreaty,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;they will be inflexible, but not to
      forgiveness. My father, though haughty, dearly, even passionately loves
      me; my mother, though high-spirited, is just, noble, and generous. She is,
      indeed, the most exalted of women, and her power over my mind I am
      unaccustomed to resist. Miss Beverley alone seems born to be her daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted Cecilia, &ldquo;as her daughter she rejects me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves, she adores you!&rdquo; cried he warmly; &ldquo;and were I not certain she
      feels your excellencies as they ought to be felt, my veneration for you <i>both</i>
      should even yet spare you my present supplication. But you would become, I
      am certain, the first blessing of her life; in you she would behold all
      the felicity of her son,&mdash;his restoration to health, to his country,
      to his friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with emotion, &ldquo;how deep a trench of real misery do
      you sink, in order to raise this pile of fancied happiness! But I will not
      be responsible for your offending such a mother; scarcely can you honour
      her yourself more than I do; and I here declare most solemnly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O stop!&rdquo; interrupted Delvile, &ldquo;and resolve not till you have heard me.
      Would you, were she no more, were my father also no more, would you yet
      persist in refusing me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you ask me?&rdquo; said Cecilia, blushing; &ldquo;you would then be your
      own agent, and perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, and Delvile vehemently exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh make me not a
      monster! force me not to desire the death of the very beings by whom I
      live! weaken not the bonds of affection by which they are endeared to me,
      and compel me not to wish them no more as the sole barriers to my
      happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;could I believe you so impious, I should
      suffer little indeed in desiring your eternal absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then only upon their extinction must I rest my hope of your favour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, staggered and distressed by this question, could make no answer.
      Delvile, perceiving her embarrassment, redoubled his urgency; and before
      she had power to recollect herself, she had almost consented to his plan,
      when Henrietta Belfield rushing into her memory, she hastily exclaimed,
      &ldquo;One doubt there is, which I know not how to mention, but ought to have
      cleared up;&mdash;you are acquainted with&mdash;you remember Miss
      Belfield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but what of Miss Belfield that can raise a doubt in the mind
      of Miss Beverley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia coloured, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;you could ever for an instant suppose&mdash;but
      I cannot even name a supposition so foreign to all possibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is surely very amiable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;she is innocent, gentle, and engaging; and I heartily
      wish she were in a better situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever occasionally, or by any accident, correspond with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were not your visits to the brother <i>sometimes</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care,&rdquo; interrupted he, laughing, &ldquo;lest I reverse the question, and
      ask if your visits to the sister were not <i>sometimes</i> for the
      brother! But what does this mean? Could Miss Beverley imagine that <i>after</i>
      knowing her, the charms of Miss Belfield could put me in any danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, bound in delicacy and friendship not to betray the tender and
      trusting Henrietta, and internally satisfied of his innocence by his
      frankness, evaded any answer; and would now have done with the subject;
      but Delvile, eager wholly to exculpate himself, though by no means
      displeased at an enquiry which shewed so much interest in his affections,
      continued his explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Belfield has, I grant, an attraction in the simplicity of her
      manners which charms by its singularity; her heart, too, seems all purity,
      and her temper all softness. I have not, you find, been blind to her
      merit; on the contrary, I have both admired and pitied her. But far indeed
      is she removed from all chance of rivalry in my heart! A character such as
      hers for a while is irresistibly alluring; but when its novelty is over,
      simplicity uninformed becomes wearisome, and softness without dignity is
      too indiscriminate to give delight. We sigh for entertainment, when cloyed
      by mere sweetness; and heavily drags on the load of life when the
      companion of our social hours wants spirit, intelligence, and cultivation.
      With Miss Beverley all these&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not of all these,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;when one single obstacle has
      power to render them valueless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that obstacle is surmounted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surmounted only for a moment! for even in your letter this morning you
      confess the regret with which it fills you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should I deceive you? Why pretend to think with pleasure, or even
      with indifference, of an obstacle which has had thus long the power to
      make me miserable? But where is happiness without allay? Is perfect bliss
      the condition of humanity? Oh if we refuse to taste it till in its last
      state of refinement, how shall the cup of evil be ever from our lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How indeed!&rdquo; said Cecilia, with a sigh; &ldquo;the regret, I believe, will
      remain eternally upon your mind, and she, perhaps, who should cause, might
      soon be taught to partake of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Miss Beverley! how have I merited this severity? Did I make my
      proposals lightly? Did I suffer my eagerness to conquer my reason? Have I
      not, on the contrary, been steady and considerate? neither biassed by
      passion nor betrayed by tenderness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet in what,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;consists this boasted steadiness? I
      perceived it indeed, at Delvile Castle, but here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pride of heart which supported me there,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;will support me
      no longer; what sustained my firmness, but your apparent severity? What
      enabled me to fly you, but your invariable coldness? The rigour with which
      I trampled upon my feelings I thought fortitude and spirit,&mdash;but I
      knew not then the pitying sympathy of Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O that you knew it not yet!&rdquo; cried she, blushing; &ldquo;before that fatal
      accident you thought of me, I believe, in a manner far more honourable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! differently, I thought of you, but never, better, never so
      well as now. I then represented you all lovely in beauty, all perfect in
      goodness and virtue; but it was virtue in its highest majesty, not, as
      now, blended with the softest sensibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;how the portrait is faded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is but more from the life; it is the sublimity of an angel,
      mingled with all that is attractive in woman. But who is the friend we may
      venture to trust? To whom may I give my bond? And from whom may I receive
      a treasure which for the rest of my life will constitute all its
      felicity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can <i>I</i>,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;find a friend, who, in this critical
      moment will instruct me how to act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find one,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;in your own bosom; ask but yourself
      this plain question; will any virtue be offended by your honouring me with
      your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; duty will be offended, since it is contrary to the will of your
      parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there no time for emancipation? Am not I of an age to chuse for
      myself the partner of my life? Will not you in a few days be the
      uncontrolled mistress of your actions? Are we not both independent? Your
      ample fortune all your own, and the estates of my father so entailed they
      must unavoidably be mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are these,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;considerations to set us free from our
      duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but they are circumstances to relieve us from slavery. Let me not
      offend you if I am still more explicit. When no law, human or divine, can
      be injured by our union, when one motive of pride is all that can be
      opposed to a thousand motives of convenience and happiness, why should we
      <i>both</i> be made unhappy, merely lest that pride should lose its
      gratification?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question, which so often and so angrily she had revolved in her own
      mind, again silenced her; and Delvile, with the eagerness of approaching
      success, redoubled his solicitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be mine,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;sweetest Cecilia, and all will go well. To refer me
      to my friends is, effectually, to banish me for ever. Spare me, then, the
      unavailing task; and save me from the resistless entreaties of a mother,
      whose every desire I have held sacred, whose wish has been my law, and
      whose commands I have implicitly, invariably obeyed! Oh generously save me
      from the dreadful alternative of wounding her maternal heart by a
      peremptory refusal, or of torturing my own with pangs to which it is
      unequal by an extorted obedience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;how utterly impossible I can relieve you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why? once mine, irrevocably mine&mdash;-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that would but irritate,&mdash;and irritate past hope of pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you are mistaken; to your merit they are far from insensible, and
      your fortune is just what they wish. Trust me, therefore, when I assure
      you that their displeasure, which both respect and justice will guard them
      from ever shewing <i>you</i>, will soon die wholly away. I speak not
      merely from my hopes; in judging my own friends, I consider human nature
      in general. Inevitable evils are ever best supported. It is suspence, it
      is hope that make the food of misery; certainty is always endured, because
      known to be past amendment, and felt to give defiance to struggling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;with reasoning so desperate be satisfied?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a situation so extraordinary as ours,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;there is no
      other. The voice of the world at large will be all in our favour. Our
      union neither injures our fortunes, nor taints our morality; with the
      character of each the other is satisfied, and both must be alike
      exculpated from mercenary views of interest, or romantic contempt of
      poverty; what right have we, then, to repine at an objection which,
      however potent, is single? Surely none. Oh if wholly unchecked were the
      happiness I now have in view, if no foul storm sometimes lowered over the
      prospect, and for the moment obscured its brightness, how could my heart
      find room for joy so superlative? The whole world might rise against me as
      the first man in it who had nothing left to wish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, whose own hopes aided this reasoning, found not much to oppose to
      it; and with little more of entreaty, and still less of argument, Delvile
      at length obtained her consent to his plan. Fearfully, indeed, and with
      unfeigned reluctance she gave it, but it was the only alternative with a
      separation for-ever, to which she held not the necessity adequate to the
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thanks of Delvile were as vehement as had been his entreaties, which
      yet, however, were not at an end; the concession she had made was
      imperfect, unless its performance were immediate, and he now endeavoured
      to prevail with her to be his before the expiration of a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, his task ceased to be difficult; Cecilia, as ingenuous by
      nature as she was honourable from principle, having once brought her mind
      to consent to his proposal, sought not by studied difficulties to enhance
      the value of her compliance; the great point resolved upon, she held all
      else of too little importance for a contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton was now called in, and acquainted with the result of their
      conference. Her approbation by no means followed the scheme of privacy;
      yet she was too much rejoiced in seeing her young friend near the period
      of her long suspence and uneasiness, to oppose any plan which might
      forward their termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile then again begged to know what male confidant might be entrusted
      with their project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton immediately occurred to Cecilia, though the certainty of his
      ill-will to the cause made all application to him disagreeable; but his
      long and steady friendship for her, his readiness to counsel and assist
      her, and the promises she had occasionally made, not to act without his
      advice, all concurred to persuade her that in a matter of such importance,
      she owed to him her confidence, and should be culpable to proceed without
      it. Upon him, therefore, she fixed; yet finding in herself a repugnance
      insuperable to acquainting him with her situation, she agreed that
      Delvile, who instantly proposed to be her messenger, should open to him
      the affair, and prepare him for their meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delvile then, rapid in thought and fertile in expedients, with a celerity
      and vigour which bore down all objections, arranged the whole conduct of
      the business. To avoid suspicion, he determined instantly to quit her,
      and, as soon as he had executed his commission with Mr Monckton, to hasten
      to London, that the necessary preparations for their marriage might be
      made with dispatch and secrecy. He purposed, also, to find out Mr
      Belfield; that he might draw up the bond with which he meant to entrust Mr
      Monckton. This measure Cecilia would have opposed, but he refused to
      listen to her. Mrs Charlton herself, though her age and infirmities had
      long confined her to her own house, gratified Cecilia upon this critical
      occasion with consenting to accompany her to the altar. Mr Monckton was
      depended upon for giving her away, and a church in London was the place
      appointed for the performance of the ceremony. In three days the principal
      difficulties to the union would be removed by Cecilia's coming of age, and
      in five days it was agreed that they should actually meet in town. The
      moment they were married Delvile promised to set off for the castle, while
      in another chaise, Cecilia returned to Mrs Charlton's. This settled, he
      conjured her to be punctual, and earnestly recommending himself to her
      fidelity and affection, he bid her adieu.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER vii. &mdash; A RETROSPECTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Left now to herself, sensations unfelt before filled the heart of Cecilia.
      All that had passed for a while appeared a dream; her ideas were
      indistinct, her memory was confused, her faculties seemed all out of
      order, and she had but an imperfect consciousness either of the
      transaction in which she had just been engaged, or of the promise she had
      bound herself to fulfil; even truth from imagination she scarcely could
      separate; all was darkness and doubt, inquietude and disorder!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when at length her recollection more clearly returned, and her
      situation appeared to her such as it really was, divested alike of false
      terrors or delusive expectations, she found herself still further removed
      from tranquility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, though no stranger to sorrow, which the sickness and early loss
      of her friends had first taught her to feel, and which the subsequent
      anxiety of her own heart had since instructed her to bear, she had yet
      invariably possessed the consolation of self-approving reflections; but
      the step she was now about to take, all her principles opposed; it
      terrified her as undutiful, it shocked her as clandestine, and scarce was
      Delvile out of sight, before she regretted her consent to it as the loss
      of her self-esteem, and believed, even if a reconciliation took place, the
      remembrance of a wilful fault would still follow her, blemish in her own
      eyes the character she had hoped to support, and be a constant allay to
      her happiness, by telling her how unworthily she had obtained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where frailty has never been voluntary, nor error stubborn, where the
      pride of early integrity is unsubdued, and the first purity of innocence
      is inviolate, how fearfully delicate, how &ldquo;tremblingly alive,&rdquo; is the
      conscience of man! strange, that what in its first state is so tender, can
      in its last become so callous!
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with the general lot of human misery, Cecilia had suffered
      nothing; but compared with the exaltation of ideal happiness, she had
      suffered much; willingly, however, would she again have borne all that had
      distressed her, experienced the same painful suspence, endured the same
      melancholy parting, and gone through the same cruel task of combating
      inclination with reason, to have relieved her virtuous mind from the
      new-born and intolerable terror of conscientious reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equity of her notions permitted her not from the earnestness of
      Delvile's entreaties to draw any palliation for her consent to his
      proposal; she was conscious that but for her own too great facility those
      entreaties would have been ineffectual, since she well knew how little
      from any other of her admirers they would have availed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But chiefly her affliction and repentance hung upon Mrs Delvile, whom she
      loved, reverenced and honoured, whom she dreaded to offend, and whom she
      well knew expected from her even exemplary virtue. Her praises, her
      partiality, her confidence in her character, which hitherto had been her
      pride, she now only recollected with shame and with sadness. The terror of
      the first interview never ceased to be present to her; she shrunk even in
      imagination from her wrath-darting eye, she felt stung by pointed satire,
      and subdued by cold contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet to disappoint Delvile so late, by forfeiting a promise so positively
      accorded; to trifle with a man who to her had been uniformly candid, to
      waver when her word was engaged, and retract when he thought himself
      secure,&mdash;honour, justice and shame told her the time was now past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet is not this,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;placing nominal before actual evil? Is
      it not studying appearance at the expence of reality? If agreeing to wrong
      is criminal, is not performing it worse? If repentance for ill actions
      calls for mercy, has not repentance for ill intentions a yet higher claim?&mdash;And
      what reproaches from Delvile can be so bitter as my own? What separation,
      what sorrow, what possible calamity can hang upon my mind with such
      heaviness, as the sense of committing voluntary evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This thought so much affected her, that, conquering all regret either for
      Delvile or herself, she resolved to write to him instantly, and acquaint
      him of the alteration in her sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, after having so deeply engaged herself, was by no means
      easy; and many letters were begun, but not one of them was finished, when
      a sudden recollection obliged her to give over the attempt,&mdash;for she
      knew not whither to direct to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the haste with which their plan had been formed and settled, it had
      never once occurred to them that any, occasion for writing was likely to
      happen. Delvile, indeed, knew that her address would still be the same;
      and with regard to his own, as his journey to London was to be secret, he
      purposed not having any fixed habitation. On the day of their marriage,
      and not before, they had appointed to meet at the house of Mrs Roberts, in
      Fetter-Lane, whence they were instantly to proceed to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might still, indeed, enclose a letter for him in one to Mrs Hill, to
      be delivered to him on the destined morning when he called to claim her;
      but to fail him at the last moment, when Mr Belfield would have drawn up
      the bond, when a licence was procured, the clergyman waiting to perform
      the ceremony, and Delvile without a suspicion but that the next moment
      would unite them for ever, seemed extending prudence into treachery, and
      power into tyranny. Delvile had done nothing to merit such treatment, he
      had practised no deceit, he had been guilty of no perfidy, he had opened
      to her his whole heart, and after shewing it without any disguise, the
      option had been all her own to accept or refuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ray of joy now broke its way through the gloom of her apprehensions.
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I have not, then, any means to recede! an unprovoked
      breach of promise at the very moment destined for its performance, would
      but vary the mode of acting wrong, without approaching nearer to acting
      right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This idea for a while not merely calmed but delighted her; to be the wife
      of Delvile seemed now a matter of necessity, and she soothed herself with
      believing that to struggle against it were vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning during breakfast Mr Monckton arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not greater, though winged with joy, had been the expedition of Delvile to
      open to him his plan, than was his own, though only goaded by desperation,
      to make some effort with Cecilia for rendering it abortive. Nor could all
      his self-denial, the command which he held over his passions, nor the
      rigour with which his feelings were made subservient to his interest, in
      this sudden hour of trial, avail to preserve his equanimity. The
      refinements of hypocrisy, and the arts of insinuation, offered advantages
      too distant, and exacted attentions too subtle, for a moment so alarming;
      those arts and those attentions he had already for many years practised,
      with an address the most masterly, and a diligence the most indefatigable;
      success had of late seemed to follow his toils; the encreasing infirmities
      of his wife, the disappointment and retirement of Cecilia, uniting to
      promise him a conclusion equally speedy and happy; when now, by a sudden
      and unexpected stroke, the sweet solace of his future cares, the
      long-projected recompence of his past sufferings, was to be snatched from
      him for ever, and by one who, compared with himself, was but the
      acquaintance of a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost wholly off his guard from the surprise and horror of this
      apprehension, he entered the room with such an air of haste and
      perturbation, that Mrs Charlton and her grand-daughters demanded what was
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come,&rdquo; he answered abruptly, yet endeavouring to recollect himself,
      &ldquo;to speak with Miss Beverley upon business of some importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, then,&rdquo; said Mrs Charlton, &ldquo;you had better go with Mr Monckton
      into your dressing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, deeply blushing, arose and led the way; slowly, however, she
      proceeded, though urged by Mr Monckton to make speed. Certain of his
      disapprobation, and but doubtfully relieved from her own, she dreaded a
      conference which on his side, she foresaw, would be all exhortation and
      reproof, and on hers all timidity and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;Miss Beverley, what is this you have done? bound
      yourself to marry a man who despises, who scorns, who refuses to own you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shocked by this opening, she started, but could make no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you not,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the indignity which is offered you? Does the
      loose, the flimsy veil with which it is covered, hide it from your
      understanding, or disguise it from your delicacy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought not,&mdash;I meant not,&rdquo; said she, more and more confounded,
      &ldquo;to submit to any indignity, though my pride, in an exigence so peculiar,
      may give way, for a while, to convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To convenience?&rdquo; repeated he, &ldquo;to contempt, to derision, to insolence!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr Monckton!&rdquo; interrupted Cecilia, &ldquo;make not use of such expressions!
      they are too cruel for me to hear, and if I thought they were just, would
      make me miserable for life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are deceived, grossly deceived,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;if you doubt their
      truth for a moment; they are not, indeed, even decently concealed from
      you; they are glaring as the day, and wilful blindness can alone obscure
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, whose confusion, at a charge so rough,
      began now to give way to anger, &ldquo;if this is your opinion; and I am sorry,
      too, for the liberty I have taken in troubling you upon such a subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An apology so full of displeasure instantly taught Mr Monckton the error
      he was committing, and checking, therefore, the violence of those emotions
      to which his sudden and desperate disappointment gave rise, and which
      betrayed him into reproaches so unskilful, he endeavoured to recover his
      accustomed equanimity, and assuming an air of friendly openness, said,
      &ldquo;Let me not offend you, my dear Miss Beverley, by a freedom which results
      merely from a solicitude to serve you, and which the length and intimacy
      of our acquaintance had, I hoped, long since authorised. I know not how to
      see you on the brink of destruction without speaking, yet, if you are
      averse to my sincerity, I will curb it, and have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do not have done,&rdquo; cried she, much softened; &ldquo;your sincerity does me
      nothing but honour, and hitherto, I am sure, it has done me nothing but
      good. Perhaps I deserve your utmost censure; I feared it, indeed, before
      you came, and ought, therefore, to have better prepared myself for meeting
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech completed Mr Monckton's self-victory; it shewed him not only
      the impropriety of his turbulence, but gave him room to hope that a
      mildness more crafty would have better success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot but be certain,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that my zeal proceeds wholly
      from a desire to be of use to you; my knowledge of the world might
      possibly, I thought, assist your inexperience, and the disinterestedness
      of my regard, might enable me to see and to point out the dangers to which
      you are exposed, from artifice and duplicity in those who have other
      purposes to answer than what simply belong to your welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither artifice nor duplicity,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, jealous for the honour of
      Delvile, &ldquo;have been practised against me. Argument, and not persuasion,
      determined me, and if I have done wrong&mdash;those who prompted me have
      erred as unwittingly as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too generous to perceive the difference, or you would find
      nothing less alike. If, however, my plainness will not offend you, before
      it is quite too late, I will point out to you a few of the evils,&mdash;for
      there are some I cannot even mention, which at this instant do not merely
      threaten, but await you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia started at this terrifying offer, and afraid to accept, yet
      ashamed to refuse, hung back irresolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, after a pause of some continuance, &ldquo;your
      determination admits no appeal. The consequence must, indeed, be all your
      own, but I am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware of its
      seriousness. Hereafter you will wish, perhaps, that the friend of your
      earliest youth had been permitted to advise you; at present you only think
      him officious and impertinent, and therefore he can do nothing you will be
      so likely to approve as quitting you. I wish you, then, greater happiness
      than seems prepared to follow you, and a counsellor more prosperous in
      offering his assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would then have taken his leave; but Cecilia called out, &ldquo;Oh, Mr
      Monckton! do you then give me up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, I know not what to wish! except, indeed, the restoration of that
      security from self-blame, which till yesterday, even in the midst of
      disappointment, quieted and consoled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you, then, sensible you have gone wrong, yet resolute not to turn
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I tell, could I see,&rdquo; cried she, with energy, &ldquo;which way I <i>ought</i>
      to turn, not a moment would I hesitate how to act! my heart should have no
      power, my happiness no choice,&mdash;I would recover my own esteem by any
      sacrifice that could be made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, can possibly be your doubt? To be as you were yesterday what
      is wanting but your own inclination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing is wanting; right, honour, firmness, all by which the just
      are bound, and all which the conscientious hold sacred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These scruples are merely romantic; your own good sense, had it fairer
      play, would contemn them; but it is warped at present by prejudice and
      prepossession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; cried she, colouring at the charge, &ldquo;I may have entered too
      precipitately into an engagement I ought to have avoided, but it is
      weakness of judgment, not of heart, that disables me from retrieving my
      error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you will neither hear whither it may lead you, nor which way you may
      escape from it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; cried she, trembling, &ldquo;I am now ready to hear both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briefly, then, I will tell you. It will lead you into a family of which
      every individual will disdain you; it will make you inmate of a house of
      which no other inmate will associate with you; you will be insulted as an
      inferior, and reproached as an intruder; your birth will be a subject of
      ridicule, and your whole race only named with derision; and while the
      elders of the proud castle treat you with open contempt, the man for whom
      you suffer will not dare to support you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! impossible!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with the most angry emotion;
      &ldquo;this whole representation is exaggerated, and the latter part is utterly
      without foundation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The latter part,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, &ldquo;is of all other least disputable;
      the man who now dares not own, will then never venture to defend you. On
      the contrary, to make peace for himself, he will be the first to neglect
      you. The ruined estates of his ancestors will be repaired by your fortune,
      while the name which you carry into his family will be constantly resented
      as an injury; you will thus be plundered though you are scorned, and told
      to consider yourself honoured that they condescend to make use of you! nor
      here rests the evil of a forced connection with so much arrogance,&mdash;even
      your children, should you have any, will be educated to despise you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful and horrible!&rdquo; cried Cecilia;&mdash;&ldquo;I can hear no more,&mdash;Oh,
      Mr Monckton, what a prospect have you opened to my view!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly from it, then, while it is yet in your power,&mdash;when two paths
      are before you, chuse not that which leads to destruction; send instantly
      after Delvile, and tell him you have recovered your senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would long since have sent,&mdash;I wanted not a representation such as
      this,&mdash;but I know not how to direct to him, nor whither he is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All art and baseness to prevent your recantation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir, no,&rdquo; cried she, with quickness; &ldquo;whatever may be the truth of
      your painting in general, all that concerns&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed of the vindication she intended, which yet in her own mind was
      firm and animated, she stopt, and left the sentence unfinished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what place were you to meet?&rdquo; said Mr Monckton; &ldquo;you can at least send
      to him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were only to have met,&rdquo; answered she, in much confusion, &ldquo;at the last
      moment,&mdash;and that would be too late&mdash;it would be too&mdash;I
      could not, without some previous notice, break a promise which I gave
      without any restriction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your only objection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is; but it is one which I cannot conquer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would give up this ill-boding connection, but from notions of
      delicacy with regard to the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I meant it, before you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>, then, will obviate this objection; give me but the commission,
      either verbally or in writing, and I will undertake to find him out, and
      deliver it before night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, little expecting this offer, turned extremely pale, and after
      pausing some moments, said in a faultering voice, &ldquo;What, then, Sir, is
      your advice, in what manner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say to him all that is necessary; trust the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;he deserves, at least, an apology from myself,&mdash;though how
      to make it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopt, she hesitated, she went out of the room for pen and ink, she
      returned without them, and the agitation of her mind every instant
      encreasing, she begged him, in a faint voice, to excuse her while she
      consulted with Mrs Charlton, and promising to wait upon him again, was
      hurrying away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton, however, saw too great danger in so much emotion to trust her
      out of his sight; he told her, therefore, that she would only encrease her
      perplexity, without reaping any advantage, by an application to Mrs
      Charlton, and that if she was really sincere in wishing to recede, there
      was not a moment to be lost, and Delvile should immediately be pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, sensible of the truth of this speech, and once more recollecting
      the unaffected earnestness with which but an hour or two before, she had
      herself desired to renounce this engagement, now summoned her utmost
      courage to her aid, and, after a short, but painful struggle, determined
      to act consistently with her professions and her character, and, by one
      great and final effort, to conclude all her doubts, and try to silence
      even her regret, by completing the triumph of fortitude over inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called, therefore, for pen and ink, and without venturing herself from
      the room, wrote the following letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Mortimer Delvile, Esq.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Accuse me not of caprice, and pardon my irresolution, when you find me
      shrinking with terror from the promise I have made, and no longer either
      able or willing to perform it. The reproaches of your family I should very
      ill endure; but the reproaches of my own heart for an action I can neither
      approve nor defend, would be still more oppressive. With such a weight
      upon the mind length of life would be burthensome; with a sensation of
      guilt early death would be terrific! These being my notions of the
      engagement into which we have entered, you cannot wonder, and you have
      still less reason to repine, that I dare not fulfil it. Alas! where would
      be your chance of happiness with one who in the very act of becoming yours
      would forfeit her own!
    </p>
    <p>
      I blush at this tardy recantation, and I grieve at the disappointment it
      may occasion you; but I have yielded to the exhortations of an inward
      monitor, who is never to be neglected with impunity. Consult him yourself,
      and I shall need no other advocate. Adieu, and may all felicity attend
      you! if to hear of the almost total privation of mine, will mitigate the
      resentment with which you will probably read this letter, it may be
      mitigated but too easily! Yet my consent to a clandestine action shall
      never be repeated; and though I confess to you I am not happy, I solemnly
      declare my resolution is unalterable. A little reflection will tell you I
      am right, though a great deal of lenity may scarce suffice to make you
      pardon my being right no sooner. C. B.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, which with trembling haste, resulting from a fear of her own
      steadiness, she folded and sealed, Mr Monckton, from the same apprehension
      yet more eagerly received, and scarce waiting to bid her good morning,
      mounted his horse, and pursued his way to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia returned to Mrs Charlton to acquaint her with what had passed; and
      notwithstanding the sorrow she felt in apparently injuring the man whom,
      in the whole world she most wished to oblige, she yet found a satisfaction
      in the sacrifice she had made, that recompensed her for much of her
      sufferings, and soothed her into something like tranquility; the true
      power of virtue she had scarce experienced before, for she found it a
      resource against the cruellest dejection, and a supporter in the bitterest
      disappointment.

      CHAPTER viii. &mdash; AN EMBARRASSMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day passed on without any intelligence; the next day, also, passed in
      the same manner, and on the third, which was her birthday, Cecilia became
      of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations which had long been making among her tenants to celebrate
      this event, Cecilia appeared to take some share, and endeavoured to find
      some pleasure in. She gave a public dinner to all who were willing to
      partake of it, she promised redress to those who complained of hard usage,
      she pardoned many debts, and distributed money, food, and clothing to the
      poor. These benevolent occupations made time seem less heavy, and while
      they freed her from solitude, diverted her suspense. She still, however,
      continued at the house of Mrs Charlton, the workmen having disappointed
      her in finishing her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in defiance of her utmost exertion, towards the evening of this day
      the uneasiness of her uncertainty grew almost intolerable. The next
      morning she had promised Delvile to set out for London, and he expected
      the morning after to claim her for his wife; yet Mr Monckton neither sent
      nor came, and she knew not if her letter was delivered, or if still he was
      unprepared for the disappointment by which he was awaited. A secret regret
      for the unhappiness she must occasion him, which silently yet powerfully
      reproached her, stole fast upon her mind, and poisoned its tranquility;
      for though her opinion was invariable in holding his proposal to be wrong,
      she thought too highly of his character to believe he would have made it
      but from a mistaken notion it was right. She painted him, therefore, to
      herself, as glowing with indignation, accusing her of inconsistency, and
      perhaps suspecting her of coquetry, and imputing her change of conduct to
      motives the most trifling and narrow, till with resentment and disdain, he
      drove her wholly from his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, however, the picture was reversed; Delvile no more
      appeared storming nor unreasonable; his face wore an aspect of sorrow, and
      his brow was clouded with disappointment; he forbore to reproach her, but
      the look which her imagination delineated was more piercing than words of
      severest import.
    </p>
    <p>
      These images pursued and tormented her, drew tears from her eyes, and
      loaded her heart with anguish. Yet, when she recollected that her conduct
      had had in view an higher motive than pleasing Delvile, she felt that it
      ought to offer her an higher satisfaction; she tried, therefore, to revive
      her spirits, by reflecting upon her integrity, and refused all indulgence
      to this enervating sadness, beyond what the weakness of human nature
      demands, as some relief to its sufferings upon every fresh attack of
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conduct such as this was the best antidote against affliction, whose
      arrows are never with so little difficulty repelled, as when they light
      upon a conscience which no self-reproach has laid bare to their
      malignancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before six o'clock the next morning, her maid came to her bedside with the
      following letter, which she told; her had been brought by an express.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Miss Beverley</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      May this letter, with one only from Delvile Castle, be the last that <i>Miss
      Beverley</i> may ever receive!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet sweet to me as is that hope, I write in the utmost uneasiness; I have
      just heard that a gentleman, whom, by the description that is given of
      him, I imagine is Mr Monckton, has been in search of me with a letter
      which he was anxious to deliver immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this letter is from Miss Beverley, perhaps it contains directions
      which ought instantly to be followed; could I divine what they are, with
      what eagerness would I study to anticipate their execution! It will not, I
      hope, be too late to receive them on Saturday, when her power over my
      actions will be confirmed, and when every wish she will communicate, shall
      be gratefully, joyfully, and with delight fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sought Belfield in vain; he has left Lord Vannelt, and no one knows
      whither he is gone. I have been obliged, therefore, to trust a stranger to
      draw up the bond; but he is a man of good character, and the time of
      secrecy will be too short to put his discretion in much danger. To-morrow,
      Friday, I shall spend solely in endeavouring to discover. Mr Monckton; I
      have leisure sufficient for the search, since so prosperous has been my
      diligence, that <i>every thing is prepared</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen some lodgings in Pall-Mall, which I think are commodious and
      will suit you; send a servant, therefore, before you to secure them. If
      upon your arrival I should venture to meet you there, be not, I beseech
      you, offended or alarmed; I shall take every possible precaution neither
      to be known nor seen, and I will stay with you only three minutes. The
      messenger who carries this is ignorant from whom it comes, for I fear his
      repeating my name among your servants, and he could scarce return to me
      with an answer before you will yourself be in town. Yes, loveliest
      Cecilia! at the very moment you receive this letter, the chaise will, I
      flatter myself, be at the door, which is to bring to me a treasure that
      will enrich every future hour of my life! And oh as to me it will be
      exhaustless, may but its sweet dispenser experience some share of the
      happiness she bestows, and then what, save her own purity, will be so
      perfect, so unsullied, as the felicity of her! M.D.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perturbation of Cecilia upon reading this letter was unspeakable; Mr
      Monckton, she found, had been wholly unsuccessful, all her heroism had
      answered no purpose, and the transaction was as backward as before she had
      exerted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, now, therefore, called upon to think and act entirely for
      herself. Her opinion was still the same, nor did her resolution waver, yet
      how to put it in execution she could not discern. To write to him was
      impossible, since she was ignorant where he was to be found; to disappoint
      him at the last moment she could not resolve, since such a conduct
      appeared to her unfeeling and unjustifiable; for a few instants she
      thought of having him waited for at night in London, with a letter; but
      the danger of entrusting any one with such a commission, and the
      uncertainty of finding him, should he disguise himself, made the success
      of this scheme too precarious for trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      One expedient alone occurred to her, which, though she felt to be
      hazardous, she believed was without an alternative; this was no other than
      hastening to London herself, consenting to the interview he had proposed
      in Pall-Mall, and then, by strongly stating her objections, and confessing
      the grief they occasioned her, to pique at once his generosity and his
      pride upon releasing her himself from the engagement into which he had
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no time to deliberate; her plan, therefore, was decided almost as
      soon as formed, and every moment being precious, she was obliged to awaken
      Mrs Charlton, and communicate to her at once the letter from Delvile, and
      the new resolution she had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton, having no object in view but the happiness of her young
      friend, with a facility that looked not for objections, and scarce saw
      them when presented, agreed to the expedition, and kindly consented to
      accompany her to London; for Cecilia, however concerned to hurry and
      fatigue her, was too anxious for the sanction of her presence to hesitate
      in soliciting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chaise, therefore, was ordered; and with posthorses for speed, and two
      servants on horseback, the moment Mrs Charlton was ready, they set out on
      their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had they proceeded two miles on their way, when they were met by Mr
      Monckton, who was hastening to their house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed and alarmed at a sight so unexpected, he stopt the chaise to
      enquire whither they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, without answering, asked if her letter had yet been received?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not,&rdquo; said Mr Monckton, &ldquo;deliver it to a man who was not to be
      found; I was at this moment coming to acquaint how vainly I had sought
      him; but still that your journey is unnecessary unless voluntary, since I
      have left it at the house where you told me you should meet to-morrow
      morning, and where he must then unavoidably receive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Sir,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;to-morrow morning will be too late,&mdash;in
      conscience, in justice, and even in decency too late! I <i>must</i>,
      therefore, go to town; yet I go not, believe me, in opposition to your
      injunctions, but to enable myself, without treachery or dishonour, to
      fulfil them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Monckton, aghast and confounded, made not any answer, till Cecilia gave
      orders to the postilion to drive on; he then hastily called to stop him,
      and began the warmest expostulations; but Cecilia, firm when she believed
      herself right, though wavering when fearful she was wrong, told him it was
      now too late to change her plan, and repeating her orders to the
      postilion, left him to his own reflections; grieved herself to reject his
      counsel, yet too intently occupied by her own affairs and designs, to
      think long of any other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ix. &mdash; A TORMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At&mdash;&mdash;they stopt for dinner; Mrs Charlton being too much
      fatigued to go on without some rest, though the haste of Cecilia to meet
      Delvile time enough for new arranging their affairs, made her regret every
      moment that was spent upon the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their meal was not long, and they were returning to their chaise, when
      they were suddenly encountered by Mr Morrice, who was just alighted from
      his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He congratulated himself upon the happiness of meeting them with the air
      of a man who nothing doubted that happiness being mutual; then hastening
      to speak of the Grove, &ldquo;I could hardly,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;get away; my friend
      Monckton won't know what to do without me, for Lady Margaret, poor old
      soul, is in a shocking bad way indeed; there's hardly any staying in the
      room with her; her breathing is just like the grunting of a hog. She can't
      possibly last long, for she's quite upon her last legs, and tumbles about
      so when she walks alone, one would swear she was drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take infirmity,&rdquo; said Mrs Charlton, who was now helped into the
      chaise, &ldquo;for intoxication, you must suppose no old person sober.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vastly well said, ma'am,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I really forgot your being an old
      lady yourself, or I should not have made the observation. However, as to
      poor Lady Margaret, she may do as well as ever by and bye, for she has an
      excellent constitution, and I suppose she has been hardly any better than
      she is now these forty years, for I remember when I was quite a boy
      hearing her called a limping old puddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll discuss this matter, if you please,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;some
      other time.&rdquo; And ordered the postilion to drive on. But before they came
      to their next stage, Morrice having changed his horse, joined them, and
      rode on by their side, begging them to observe what haste he had made on
      purpose to have the pleasure of escorting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This forwardness was very offensive to Mrs Charlton, whose years and
      character had long procured her more deference and respect; but Cecilia,
      anxious only to hasten her journey, was indifferent to every thing, save
      what retarded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same Inn they both again changed horses, and he still continued
      riding with them, and occasionally talking, till they were within twenty
      miles of London, when a disturbance upon the road exciting his curiosity,
      he hastily rode away from them to enquire into its cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon coming up to the place whence it proceeded, they saw a party of
      gentlemen on horseback surrounding a chaise which had been just
      overturned; and while the confusion in the road obliged the postilion to
      stop Cecilia heard a lady's voice exclaiming, &ldquo;I declare I dare say I am
      killed!&rdquo; and instantly recollecting Miss Larolles, the fear of discovery
      and delay made her desire the man to drive on with all speed. He was
      preparing to obey her, but Morrice, gallopping after them, called out,
      &ldquo;Miss Beverley, one of the ladies that has been overturned, is an
      acquaintance of yours. I used to see her with you at Mrs Harrel's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said Cecilia, much disconcerted, &ldquo;I hope she is not hurt?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all; but the lady with her is bruised to death; won't you come
      and see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too much in haste at present,&mdash;and I can do them no good; but
      Mrs Charlton I am sure will spare her servant, if he can be of any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O but the young lady wants to speak to you; she is coming up to the
      chaise as fast as ever she can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how should she know me?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, with much surprise; &ldquo;I am
      sure she could not see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I told her,&rdquo;, answered Morrice, with a nod of self-approbation for
      what he had done, &ldquo;I told her it was you, for I knew I could soon overtake
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Displeasure at this officiousness was unavailing, for looking out of the
      window, she perceived Miss Larolles, followed by half her party, not three
      paces from the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my dear creature,&rdquo; she called out, &ldquo;what a terrible accident! I assure
      you I am so monstrously frightened you've no idea. It's the luckiest thing
      in the world that you were going this way. Never any thing happened so
      excessively provoking; you've no notion what a fall we've had. It's horrid
      shocking, I assure you. How have you been all this time? You can't
      conceive how glad I am to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to which will Miss Beverley answer first,&rdquo; cried a voice which
      announced Mr Gosport, &ldquo;the joy or the sorrow? For so adroitly are they
      blended, that a common auditor could with difficulty decide, whether
      condolence, or congratulation should have the precedency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be so excessive horrid,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;to talk of
      congratulation, when one's in such a shocking panic that one does not know
      if one's dead or alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead, then, for any wager,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;if we may judge by your
      stillness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire, now, you won't begin joking,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;for I assure you it's
      an excessive serious affair. I was never so rejoiced in my life as when I
      found I was not killed. I've been so squeezed you've no notion. I thought
      for a full hour I had broke both my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my heart at the same time,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport; &ldquo;I hope you did not
      imagine that the least fragile of the three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All our hearts, give me leave to add,&rdquo; said Captain Aresby&mdash;just
      then advancing, &ldquo;all our hearts must have been <i>abimés</i>, by the
      indisposition of Miss Larolles, had not their doom been fortunately
      revoked by the sight of Miss Beverley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is excessive odd,&rdquo;, cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;that every body
      should run away so from poor Mrs Mears; she'll be so affronted you've no
      idea. I thought, Captain Aresby, you would have stayed to take care of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll run and see how she is myself,&rdquo; cried Morrice, and away he
      gallopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, ma'am,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;I am quite <i>au desespoir</i> to have
      failed in any of my devoirs; but I make it a principle to be a mere looker
      on upon these occasions, lest I should be so unhappy as to commit any <i>faux
      pas</i> by too much <i>empressement</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An admirable caution!&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;and, to so ardent a temper, a
      necessary check!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, whom the surprise and vexation of so unseasonable a meeting, when
      she particularly wished to have escaped all notice, had hitherto kept in
      painful silence, began now to recover some presence of mind; and making
      her compliments to Miss Larolles and Mr Gosport, with a slight bow to the
      Captain, she apologized for hurrying away, but told them she had an
      engagement in London which could not be deferred, and was then giving
      orders to the postilion to drive on, when Morrice returning full speed,
      called out &ldquo;The poor lady's so bad she is not able to stir a step; she
      can't put a foot to the ground, and she says she's quite black and blue;
      so I told her I was sure Miss Beverley would not refuse to make room for
      her in her chaise, till the other can be put to rights; and she says she
      shall take it as a great favour. Here, postilion, a little more to the
      right! come, ladies and gentlemen, get out of the way.&rdquo; This impertinence,
      however extraordinary, Cecilia could not oppose; for Mrs Charlton, ever
      compassionate and complying where there was any appearance of distress,
      instantly seconded the proposal; the chaise, therefore, was turned back,
      and she was obliged to offer a place in it to Mrs Mears, who, though more
      frightened than hurt, readily accepted it, notwithstanding, to make way
      for her without incommoding Mrs Charlton, she was forced to get out
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She failed not, however, to desire that all possible expedition might be
      used in refitting the other chaise for their reception; and all the
      gentlemen but one, dismounted their horses, in order to assist, or seem to
      assist in getting it ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      This only unconcerned spectator in the midst of the apparent general
      bustle, was Mr Meadows; who viewed all that passed without troubling
      himself to interfere, and with an air of the most evident carelessness
      whether matters went well or went ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Larolles, now returning to the scene of action, suddenly screamed
      out, &ldquo;O dear, where's my little dog! I never thought of him, I declare! I
      love him better than any thing in the world. I would not have him hurt for
      a hundred thousand pounds. Lord, where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crushed or suffocated in the overturn, no doubt,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport; &ldquo;but
      as you must have been his executioner, what softer death could he die? If
      you will yourself inflict the punishment, I will submit to the same fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, how you love to plague one!&rdquo; cried she and then enquired among the
      servants what was become of her dog. The poor little animal, forgotten by
      its mistress, and disregarded by all others, was now discovered by its
      yelping; and soon found to have been the most material sufferer by the
      overturn, one of its fore legs being broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could screams or lamentations, reproaches to the servants, or complaints
      against the Destinies, have abated his pain, or made a callus of the
      fracture, but short would have been the duration of his misery; for
      neither words were saved, nor lungs were spared, the very air was rent
      with cries, and all present were upbraided as if accomplices in the
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postilion, at length, interrupted this vociferation with news that the
      chaise was again fit for use; and Cecilia, eager to be gone, finding him
      little regarded, repeated what he said to Miss Larolles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chaise?&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;why you don't suppose I'll ever get into that
      horrid chaise any more? I do assure you I would not upon any account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not get into it?&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;for what purpose, then, have we all
      waited till it was ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I declare I would not go in it for forty thousand worlds. I would
      rather walk to an inn, if it's a hundred and fifty miles off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as it happens,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;to be only seven miles, I fancy you
      will condescend to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven miles! Lord, how shocking! you frighten me so you have no idea.
      Poor Mrs Mears! She'll have to go quite alone. I dare say the chaise will
      be down fifty times by the way. Ten to one but she breaks her neck! only
      conceive how horrid! I assure you I am excessive glad I am out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very friendly, indeed!&rdquo; said Mr Gosport. &ldquo;Mrs Mears, then, may break her
      bones at her leisure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Mears, however, when applied to, professed an equal aversion to the
      carriage in which she had been so unfortunate, and declared she would
      rather walk than return to it, though one of her ancles was already so
      swelled that she could hardly stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then the best way, ladies,&rdquo; cried Morrice, with the look of a man
      happy in vanquishing all difficulties, &ldquo;will be for Mrs Charlton, and that
      poor lady with the bruises, to go together in that sound chaise, and then
      for us gentlemen to escort this young lady and Miss Beverley on foot, till
      we all come to the next inn. Miss Beverley, I know, is an excellent
      walker, for I have heard Mr Monckton say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, though in the utmost consternation at a proposal, which must so
      long retard a journey she had so many reasons to wish hastened, knew not
      how either in decency or humanity to oppose it; and the fear of raising
      suspicion, from a consciousness how much there was to suspect, forced her
      to curb her impatience, and reduced her even to repeat the offer which
      Morrice had made, though she could scarce look at him for anger at his
      unseasonable forwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      No voice dissenting, the troop began to be formed. The foot consisted of
      the two young ladies, and Mr Gosport, who alighted to walk with Cecilia;
      the cavalry, of Mr Meadows, the Captain, and Morrice, who walked their
      horses a foot pace, while the rest of the party rode on with the chaise,
      as attendants upon Mrs Mears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they set off, Mr Meadows, riding negligently up to the
      carriage, exerted himself so far as to say to Mrs Mears, &ldquo;Are you hurt,
      ma'am?&rdquo; and, at the same instant, seeming to recollect Cecilia, he turned
      about, and yawning while he touched his hat, said, &ldquo;O, how d'ye do,
      ma'am?&rdquo; and then, without waiting an answer to either of his questions,
      flapped it over his eyes, and joined the cavalcade, though without
      appearing to have any consciousness that he belonged to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia would most gladly have used the rejected chaise herself, but could
      not make such a proposal to Mrs Charlton, who was past the age and the
      courage for even any appearance of enterprize. Upon enquiry, however, she
      had the satisfaction to hear that the distance to the next stage was but
      two miles, though multiplied to seven by the malice of Mr Gosport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Larolles carried her little dog in her arms, declaring she would
      never more trust him a moment away from her. She acquainted Cecilia that
      she had been for some time upon a visit to Mrs Mears, who, with the rest
      of the party, had taken her to see&mdash;house and gardens, where they had
      made an early dinner, from which they were just returning home when the
      chaise broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then proceeded, with her usual volubility, to relate the little
      nothings that had passed since the winter, flying from subject to subject,
      with no meaning but to be heard, and no wish but to talk, ever rapid in
      speech, though minute in detail. This loquacity met not with any
      interruption, save now and then a sarcastic remark, from Mr Gosport; for
      Cecilia was too much occupied by her own affairs, to answer or listen to
      such uninteresting discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silence, however, was at length forcibly broken; Mr Gosport, taking
      advantage of the first moment Miss Larolles stopt for breath, said, &ldquo;Pray
      what carries you to town, Miss Beverley, at this time of the year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, whose thoughts had been wholly employed upon what would pass at
      her approaching meeting with Delvile, was so entirely unprepared for this
      question, that she could make to it no manner of answer, till Mr Gosport,
      in a tone of some surprise, repeated it, and then, not without hesitation,
      she said, &ldquo;I have some business, Sir, in London,&mdash;pray how long have
      you been in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, have you?&rdquo; cried he, struck by her evasion; &ldquo;and pray what can
      you and business have in common?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than you may imagine,&rdquo; answered she, with greater steadiness; &ldquo;and
      perhaps before long I may even have enough to teach me the enjoyment of
      leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you don't pretend to play my Lady Notable, and become your own
      steward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can I do better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Why seek one ready made to take the trouble off your hands. There
      are such creatures to be found, I promise you; beasts of burthen, who will
      freely undertake the management of your estate, for no other reward than
      the trifling one of possessing it. Can you no where meet with such an
      animal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered she, laughing, &ldquo;I have not been looking out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have none such made application to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no,&mdash;I believe not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, fie! no register-office keeper has been pestered with more
      claimants. You know they assault you by dozens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must pardon me, indeed, I know not any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, then, why they do not, and that is much the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may conjecture why, at least; the place, I suppose, is not worth the
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; the place, they conclude, is already seized, and the fee&mdash;simple
      of the estate is the heart of the owner. Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heart of the owner,&rdquo; answered she, a little confused, &ldquo;may, indeed,
      be simple, but not, perhaps, so easily seized as you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, wisely saved it from a storm, by a generous surrender?
      you have been, indeed, in an excellent school for the study both of attack
      and defence; Delvile-Castle is a fortress which, even in ruins, proves its
      strength by its antiquity; and it teaches, also, an admirable lesson, by
      displaying the dangerous, the infallible power of time, which defies all
      might, and undermines all strength; which breaks down every barrier, and
      shews nothing endurable but itself.&rdquo; Then looking at her with an arch
      earnestness, &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you made a long visit there; did this
      observation never occur to you? did you never perceive, never <i>feel</i>,
      rather, the insidious properties of time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; answered she, alarmed at the very mention of Delvile
      Castle, yet affecting to understand literally what was said
      metaphorically, &ldquo;the havoc of time upon the place could not fail striking
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was its havoc,&rdquo; said he, yet more archly, &ldquo;merely external? is all
      within safe? sound and firm? and did the length of your residence shew its
      power by no new mischief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, not,&rdquo; answered she, with the same pretended ignorance, &ldquo;the
      place is not in so desperate a condition as to exhibit any visible marks
      of decay in the course of three or four months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, do you not know,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that the place to which I allude may
      receive a mischief in as many minutes which double the number of years
      cannot rectify? The internal parts of a building are not less vulnerable
      to accident than its outside; and though the evil may more easily be
      concealed, it will with greater difficulty be remedied. Many a fair
      structure have I seen, which, like that now before me&rdquo; (looking with much
      significance at Cecilia), &ldquo;has to the eye seemed perfect in all its parts,
      and unhurt either by time or casualty, while within, some lurking evil,
      some latent injury, has secretly worked its way into the very <i>heart</i>
      of the edifice, where it has consumed its strength, and laid waste its
      powers, till, sinking deeper and deeper, it has sapped its very
      foundation, before the superstructure has exhibited any token of danger.
      Is such an accident among the things you hold to be possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your language,&rdquo; said she, colouring very high, &ldquo;is so florid, that I must
      own it renders your meaning rather obscure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I illustrate it by an example? Suppose, during your abode in
      Delvile Castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted she, with involuntary quickness, &ldquo;why should I
      trouble you to make illustrations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O pray, my dear creature,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;how is Mrs Harrel? I was
      never so sorry for any body in my life. I quite forgot to ask after her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, poor Harrel!&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;he was a great loss to his friends. I
      had just begun to have a regard for him; we were growing extremely
      intimate. Poor fellow! he really gave most excellent dinners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrel?&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Mr Meadows, who seemed just then to first
      hear what was going forward, &ldquo;who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, as good-natured a fellow as ever I knew in my life,&rdquo; answered Morrice;
      &ldquo;he was never out of humour; he was drinking and singing and dancing to
      the very last moment. Don't you remember him, Sir, that night at
      Vauxhall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows made not any answer, but rode languidly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrice, ever more flippant than sagacious, called out, &ldquo;I really believe
      the gentleman's deaf! he won't so much as say <i>umph</i>, and <i>hay</i>,
      now; but I'll give him such a hallow in his ears, as shall make him hear
      me, whether he will or no. Sir! I say!&rdquo; bawling aloud, &ldquo;have you forgot
      that night at Vauxhall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, starting at being thus shouted at, looked towards Morrice with
      some surprise, and said, &ldquo;Were you so obliging, Sir, as to speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, yes, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, amazed; &ldquo;I thought you had asked something
      about Mr Harrel, so I just made an answer to it;&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are very good,&rdquo; returned he, slightly bowing, and then looking
      another way, as if thoroughly satisfied with what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say, Sir,&rdquo; resumed Morrice, &ldquo;don't you remember how Mr Harrel&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr who, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Harrel, Sir; was not you just now asking me who he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ay, true,&rdquo; cried Meadows, in a tone of extreme weariness, &ldquo;I am much
      obliged to you. Pray give my respects to him.&rdquo; And, touching his hat, he
      was riding away; but the astonished Morrice called out, &ldquo;Your respects to
      him? why lord! Sir, don't you know he's dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&mdash;who, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mr Harrel, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrel?&mdash;O, very true,&rdquo; cried Meadows, with a face of sudden
      recollection; &ldquo;he shot himself, I think, or was knocked down, or something
      of that sort. I remember it perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O pray,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;don't let's talk about it, it's the
      cruellest thing I ever knew in my life. I assure you I was so shocked, I
      thought I should never have got the better of it. I remember the next
      night at Ranelagh I could talk of nothing else. I dare say I told it to
      500 people. I assure you I was tired to death; only conceive how
      distressing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent method,&rdquo; cried Mr Gosport, &ldquo;to drive it out of your own
      head, by driving it into the heads of your neighbours! But were you not
      afraid, by such an ebullition of pathos, to burst as many hearts as you
      had auditors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O I assure you,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;every body was so excessive shocked you've
      no notion; one heard of nothing else; all the world was raving mad about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really yes,&rdquo; cried the Captain; &ldquo;the subject was <i>obsedé</i> upon one
      <i>partout</i>. There was scarce any breathing for it; it poured from all
      directions; I must confess I was <i>aneanti</i> with it to a degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the most shocking thing in nature,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;was going
      to the sale. I never missed a single day. One used to meet the whole world
      there, and every body was so sorry you can't conceive. It was quite
      horrid. I assure you I never suffered so much before; it made me so
      unhappy you can't imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am most ready to grant,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;be the powers of
      imagination ever so eccentric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Robert Floyer and Mr Marriot,&rdquo; continued Miss Larolles, &ldquo;have behaved
      so ill you've no idea, for they have done nothing ever since but say how
      monstrously Mr Harrel had cheated them, and how they lost such immense
      sums by him;&mdash;only conceive how ill-natured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they complain,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;that old Mr Delvile used them worse;
      for that when they had been defrauded of all that money on purpose to pay
      their addresses to Miss Beverley, he would never let them see her, but all
      of a sudden took her off into the country, on purpose to marry her to his
      own son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cheeks of Cecilia now glowed with the deepest blushes; but finding by
      a general silence that she was expected to make some answer, she said,
      with what unconcern she could assume, &ldquo;They were very much mistaken; Mr
      Delvile had no such view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; cried Mr Gosport, again perceiving her change of countenance;
      &ldquo;and is it possible you have actually escaped a siege, while every body
      concluded you taken by assault? Pray where is young Delvile at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't&mdash;I can't tell, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it long since you have seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is two months,&rdquo; answered she, with yet more hesitation, &ldquo;since I was
      at Delvile Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;did not you see him while he was in Suffolk? I
      believe, indeed, he is there now, for it was only yesterday I heard of his
      coming down, by a gentleman who called upon Lady Margaret, and told us he
      had seen a stranger, a day or two ago, at Mrs Charlton's door, and when he
      asked who he was, they told him his name was Delvile, and said he was on a
      visit at Mr Biddulph's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was quite confounded by this speech; to have it known that Delvile
      had visited her, was in itself alarming, but to have her own equivocation
      thus glaringly exposed, was infinitely more dangerous. The just suspicions
      to which it must give rise filled her with dread, and the palpable evasion
      in which she had been discovered, overwhelmed, her with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you had forgotten,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, looking at her with much
      archness, &ldquo;that you had seen him <i>within</i> the two months? but no
      wonder; for where is the lady who having so many admirers, can be at the
      trouble to remember which of them she saw last? or who, being so
      accustomed to adulation, can hold it worth while to enquire whence it
      comes? A thousand Mr Delviles are to Miss Beverley but as one; used from
      them all to the same tale, she regards them not individually as lovers,
      but collectively as men; and to gather, even from herself, which she is
      most inclined to favour, she must probably desire, like Portia in the
      Merchant of Venice, that their names may be run over one by one, before
      she can distinctly tell which is which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gallant gaiety of this speech was some relief to Cecilia, who was
      beginning a laughing reply, when Morrice called out, &ldquo;That man looks as if
      he was upon the scout.&rdquo; And, raising her eyes, she perceived a man on
      horseback, who, though much muffled up, his hat flapped, and a
      handkerchief held to his mouth and chin, she instantly, by his air and
      figure, recognized to be Delvile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In much consternation at this sight, she forgot what she meant to say, and
      dropping her eyes, walked silently on. Mr Gosport, attentive to her
      motions, looked from her to the horseman, and after a short examination,
      said, &ldquo;I think I have seen that man before; have <i>you</i>, Miss
      Beverley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&mdash;no,&rdquo;&mdash;answered she, &ldquo;I believe not,&mdash;I hardly indeed,
      see him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> have, I am pretty sure,&rdquo; said Morrice; &ldquo;and if I could see his
      face, I dare say I should recollect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems very willing to know if he can recollect any of <i>us</i>,&rdquo; said
      Mr Gosport, &ldquo;and, if I am not mistaken, he sees much better than he is
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now come up to them, and though a glance sufficed to discover the
      object of his search, the sight of the party with which she was surrounded
      made him not dare stop or speak to her, and therefore, clapping spurs to
      his horse, he galloped past them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; cried Morrice, looking after him, &ldquo;how he turns round to examine
      us! I wonder who he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps some highwayman!&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles; &ldquo;I assure you I am in a
      prodigious fright; I should hate to be robbed so you can't think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to make much the same conjecture,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;and, if
      I am not greatly deceived, that man is a robber of no common sort. What
      think you, Miss Beverley, can you discern a thief in disguise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; I pretend to no such extraordinary knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true; for all that you pretend to is extraordinary ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good mind,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;to ride after him, and see what he is
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, greatly alarmed &ldquo;there can certainly be no
      occasion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, pray don't,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;for I assure you if he should come
      back to rob us, I should die upon the spot. Nothing could be so
      disagreeable I should scream so, you've no idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrice then gave up the proposal, and they walked quietly on; but Cecilia
      was extremely disturbed by this accident; she readily conjectured that,
      impatient for her arrival, Delvile had ridden that way, to see what had
      retarded her, and she was sensible that nothing could be so desirable as
      an immediate explanation of the motive of her journey. Such a meeting,
      therefore, had she been alone, was just what she could have wished,
      though, thus unluckily encompassed, it only added to her anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily, however, she quickened her pace, through her eagerness to
      be relieved from so troublesome a party; but Miss Larolles, who was in no
      such haste, protested she could not keep up with her; saying, &ldquo;You don't
      consider that I have got this sweet little dog to carry, and he is such a
      shocking plague to me you've no notion. Only conceive what a weight he
      is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, ma'am,&rdquo; cried Morrice, &ldquo;let me take him for you; I'll be very
      careful of him, I promise you; and you need not be afraid to trust me, for
      I understand more about dogs than about any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Larolles, after many fond caresses, being really weary, consented,
      and Morrice placed the little animal before him on horseback; but while
      this matter was adjusting, and Miss Larolles was giving directions how she
      would have it held, Morrice exclaimed, &ldquo;Look, look! that man is coming
      back! He is certainly watching us. There! now he's going off again!&mdash;I
      suppose he saw me remarking him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he's laying in wait to rob us,&rdquo; said Miss Larolles; &ldquo;so when
      we turn off the high road, to go to Mrs Mears, I suppose he'll come
      galloping after us. It's excessive horrid, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a petrifying thing,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;that one must always be <i>degouté</i>
      by some wretched being or other of this sort; but pray be not deranged, I
      will ride after him, if you please, and do <i>mon possible</i> to get rid
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I wish you would,&rdquo; answered Miss Larolles, &ldquo;for I assure you he
      has put such shocking notions into my head, it's quite disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make it a principle,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;to have the honour of
      obeying you.&rdquo; And was riding off, when Cecilia, in great agitation, called
      out &ldquo;Why should you go, Sir?&mdash;he is not in our way,&mdash;pray let
      him alone,&mdash;for what purpose should you pursue him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;for the purpose of making him join our
      company, to some part of which I fancy he would be no very intolerable
      addition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech again silenced Cecilia, who perceived, with the utmost
      confusion, that both Delvile and herself were undoubtedly suspected by Mr
      Gosport, if not already actually betrayed to him. She was obliged,
      therefore, to let the matter take its course, though quite sick with
      apprehension lest a full discovery should follow the projected pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, who wanted not courage, however deeply in vanity and
      affectation he had buried common sense, stood suspended, upon the request
      of Cecilia, that he would not go, and, with a shrug of distress, said,
      &ldquo;Give me leave to own I am <i>parfaitment</i> in a state the most <i>accablant</i>
      in the world; nothing could give me greater pleasure than to profit of the
      occasion to accommodate either of these ladies; but as they proceed upon
      different principles, I am <i>indecidé</i> to a degree which way to turn
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it to the vote, then,&rdquo; said Morrice; &ldquo;the two ladies have both spoke;
      now, then, for the gentlemen. Come, Sir,&rdquo; to Mr Gosport, &ldquo;what say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, fetch the culprit back, by all means,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;and then let us
      all insist upon his opening his cause, by telling us in what he has
      offended us; for there is no part of his business, I believe, with which
      we are less acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;I'm for asking him a few questions too; so is the
      Captain; so every body has spoke but you, Sir,&rdquo; addressing himself to Mr
      Meadows, &ldquo;So now, Sir, let's hear your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows, appearing wholly inattentive, rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir, I say!&rdquo; cried Morrice, louder, &ldquo;we are all waiting for your
      vote. Pray what is the gentleman's name? it's deuced hard to make him hear
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Meadows,&rdquo; said Miss Larolles, in a low voice, &ldquo;and I assure
      you sometimes he won't hear people by the hour together. He's so excessive
      absent you've no notion. One day he made me so mad, that I could not help
      crying; and Mr Sawyer was standing by the whole time! and I assure you I
      believe he laughed at me. Only conceive how distressing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;it's out of bashfulness perhaps he thinks we
      shall cut him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bashfulness,&rdquo; repeated Miss Larolles; &ldquo;Lord, you don't conceive the thing
      at all. Why he's at the very head of the <i>ton</i>. There's nothing in
      the world so fashionable as taking no notice of things, and never seeing
      people, and saying nothing at all, and never hearing a word, and not
      knowing one's own acquaintance. All the <i>ton</i> people do so, and I
      assure you as to Mr Meadows, he's so excessively courted by every body,
      that if he does but say a syllable, he thinks it such an immense favour,
      you've no idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This account, however little alluring in itself, of his celebrity, was yet
      sufficient to make Morrice covet his further acquaintance; for Morrice was
      ever attentive to turn his pleasure to his profit, and never negligent of
      his interest, but when ignorant how to pursue it. He returned, therefore,
      to the charge, though by no means with the same freedom he had begun it,
      and lowering his voice to a tone of respect and submission, he said,
      &ldquo;Pray, Sir, may we take the liberty to ask your advice, whether we shall
      go on, or take a turn back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meadows made not any answer; but when Morrice was going to repeat his
      question, without appearing even to know that he was near him, he abruptly
      said to Miss Larolles, &ldquo;Pray what is become of Mrs Mears? I don't see her
      amongst us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Mr Meadows,&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;how can you be so odd? Don't you
      remember she went on in a chaise to the inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ay, true,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I protest I had quite forgot it; I beg your
      pardon, indeed. Yes, I recollect now,&mdash;she fell off her horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her horse? Why you know she was in her chaise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her chaise, was it?&mdash;ay, true, so it was. Poor thing!&mdash;I am
      glad she was not hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hurt? Why she's so excessively bruised, she can't stir a step! Only
      conceive what a memory you've got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most extremely sorry for her indeed,&rdquo; cried he, again stretching
      himself and yawning; &ldquo;poor soul!&mdash;I hope she won't die. Do you think
      she will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; repeated Miss Larolles, with a scream, &ldquo;Lord, how shocking! You are
      really enough to frighten one to hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;I wish you would be so kind as to give us your
      vote; the man will else be gone so far, we sha'n't be able to overtake
      him.&mdash;Though I do really believe that is the very fellow coming back
      to peep at us again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am <i>ennuyé</i> to a degree,&rdquo; cried the Captain; &ldquo;he is certainly set
      upon us as a spy, and I must really beg leave to enquire of him upon what
      principle he incommodes us.&rdquo;&mdash;And instantly he rode after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so will I too,&rdquo; cried Morrice, following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Larolles screamed after him to give her first her little dog; but
      with a schoolboy's eagerness to be foremost, he galloped on without
      heeding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uneasiness of Cecilia now encreased every moment; the discovery of
      Delvile seemed unavoidable, and his impatient and indiscreet watchfulness
      must have rendered the motives of his disguise but too glaring. All she
      had left to hope was arriving at the inn before the detection was
      announced, and at least saving herself the cruel mortification of hearing
      the raillery which would follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this, however, was not allowed her; Miss Larolles, whom she had no
      means to quit, hardly stirred another step, from her anxiety for her dog,
      and the earnestness of her curiosity about the stranger. She loitered,
      stopt now to talk, and now to listen, and was scarce moved a yard from the
      spot where she had been left, when the Captain and Morrice returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not for our lives overtake the fellow,&rdquo; said Morrice; &ldquo;he was
      well mounted, I promise you, and I'll warrant he knows what he's about,
      for he turned off so short at a place where there were two narrow lanes,
      that we could not make out which way he went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, relieved and delighted by this unexpected escape, now recovered
      her composure, and was content to saunter on without repining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But though we could not seize his person,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;we have
      debarrassed ourselves <i>tout à fait</i> from his pursuit; I hope,
      therefore, Miss Larolles will make a revoke of her apprehensions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this was nothing but a loud scream, with an exclamation,
      &ldquo;Lord, where's my dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dog!&rdquo; cried Morrice, looking aghast, &ldquo;good stars! I never thought of
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How excessive barbarous!&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;you've killed him, I dare
      say. Only think how shocking! I had rather have seen any body served so in
      the world. I shall never forgive it, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, ma'am,&rdquo; said Morrice, &ldquo;how can you suppose I've killed him? Poor,
      pretty creature, I'm sure I liked him prodigiously. I can't think for my
      life where he can be; but I have a notion he must have dropt down some
      where while I happened to be on the full gallop. I'll go look [for] him,
      however, for we went at such a rate that I never missed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away again rode Morrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am <i>abimé</i> to the greatest degree,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;that the
      poor little sweet fellow should be lost if I had thought him in any
      danger, I would have made it a principle to have had a regard to his
      person myself. Will you give me leave, ma'am, to have the honour of
      seeking him <i>partout?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I wish you would with all my heart; for I assure you if I don't find
      him, I shall think it so excessive distressing you can't conceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain touched his hat, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      These repeated impediments almost robbed Cecilia of all patience; yet her
      total inability of resistance obliged her to submit, and compelled her to
      go, stop, or turn, according to their own motions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if Mr Meadows had the least good-nature in the world,&rdquo; said Miss
      Larolles, &ldquo;he would offer to help us; but he's so excessive odd, that I
      believe if we were all of us to fall down and break our necks, he would be
      so absent he would hardly take the trouble to ask us how we did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in so desperate a case,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, &ldquo;the trouble would be
      rather superfluous. However, don't repine that one of the cavaliers stays
      with us by way of guard, lest your friend the spy should take us by
      surprize while our troop is dispersed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;now you put it in my head, I dare say that
      wretch has got my dog! only think how horrid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw plainly,&rdquo; said Mr Gosport, looking significantly at Cecilia, &ldquo;that
      he was feloniously inclined, though I must confess I took him not for a
      dog-stealer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Larolles then, running up to Mr Meadows, called out, &ldquo;I have a
      prodigious immense favour to ask of you, Mr Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am!&rdquo; cried Mr Meadows, with his usual start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only to know, whether if that horrid creature should come back, you
      could not just ride up to him and shoot him, before he gets to us? Now
      will you promise me to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are vastly good,&rdquo; said he, with a vacant smile; &ldquo;what a charming
      evening! Do you love the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, vastly; only I'm so monstrously tired, I can hardly stir a step. Do
      <i>you</i> like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country? O no! I detest it! Dusty hedges, and chirping sparrows! 'Tis
      amazing to me any body can exist upon such terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;I'm quite of your opinion. I hate
      the country so you've no notion. I wish with all my heart it was all under
      ground. I declare, when I first go into it for the summer, I cry so you
      can't think. I like nothing but London.&mdash;Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London!&rdquo; repeated Mr Meadows, &ldquo;O melancholy! the sink of all vice and
      depravity. Streets without light! Houses without air! Neighbourhood
      without society! Talkers without listeners!&mdash;'Tis astonishing any
      rational being can endure to be so miserably immured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Mr Meadows,&rdquo; cried she, angrily, &ldquo;I believe you would have one live
      no where!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, very true, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, yawning, &ldquo;one really lives no where;
      one does but vegetate, and wish it all at an end. Don't you find it so,
      ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? no indeed; I assure you I like living of all things. Whenever I'm
      ill, I'm in such a fright you've no idea. I always think I'm going to die,
      and it puts me so out of spirits you can't think. Does not it you, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Meadows, looking another way, began to whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; cried Miss Larolles, &ldquo;how excessive distressing! to ask one
      questions, and then never hear what one answers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Captain returned alone; and Miss Larolles, flying to meet him,
      demanded where was her dog?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the <i>malbeur</i> to assure you,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;that I never was
      more <i>aneanti</i> in my life! the pretty little fellow has broke another
      leg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Larolles, in a passion of grief, then declared she was certain that
      Morrice had maimed him thus on purpose, and desired to know where the vile
      wretch was?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was so much discomposed at the incident,&rdquo; replied the Captain, &ldquo;that
      he rode instantly another way. I took up the pretty fellow therefore
      myself, and have done <i>mon possible</i> not to derange him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate little animal was then delivered to Miss Larolles; and
      after much lamentation, they at length continued their walk; and, without
      further adventure, arrived at the inn.

      CHAPTER i
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN INTERRUPTION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But here, instead of finding, as she expected, Mrs Charlton, and fresh
      horses in readiness, Cecilia saw neither chaise nor preparation; Mrs
      Charlton was quietly seated in a parlour, and drinking tea with Mrs Mears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vexed and disappointed, she ordered horses immediately to the chaise, and
      entreated Mrs Charlton to lose no more time. But the various delays which
      had already retarded them, had made it now so late that it was impossible
      to get into London by daylight, and Mrs Charlton not having courage to be
      upon the road after dark, had settled to sleep at the inn, and purposed
      not to proceed till the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half distracted at this new difficulty, Cecilia begged to speak with her
      alone, and then represented in the most earnest manner, the absolute
      necessity there was for her being in London that night; &ldquo;Every thing,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;depends upon it, and the whole purpose of my journey will
      otherwise be lost, for Mr Delvile will else think himself extremely ill
      used, and to make him reparation, I may be compelled to submit to almost
      whatever terms he shall propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton, kind and yielding, withstood not this entreaty, which
      Cecilia made with infinite pain to herself, from the reluctance she felt
      to pursuing her own interest and inclination in opposition to those of her
      worthy old friend; but as she was now circumstanced, she considered the
      immediate prosecution of her journey as her only resource against first
      irritating Delvile by an abrupt disappointment, and appeasing him next by
      a concession which would make that disappointment end in nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaise was soon ready, and Mrs Charlton and Cecilia were rising to
      take leave of the company, when a man and horse galloped full speed into
      the inn-yard, and in less than a minute, Morrice bounced into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; cried he, quite out of breath with haste, &ldquo;I have
      got some news for you! I've just found out who that person is that has
      been watching us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, starting at this most unwelcome intelligence, would now have run
      into the chaise without hearing him proceed; but Mrs Charlton, who knew
      neither whom nor what he meant, involuntarily stopt, and Cecilia, whose
      arm she leant upon, was compelled to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one else eagerly desired to know who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I'll tell you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how I found him out. I was thinking in my
      own mind what I could possibly do to make amends for that unlucky accident
      about the dog, and just then I spied the very man that had made me drop
      him; so I thought at least I'd find out who he was. I rode up to him so
      quick that he could not get away from me, though I saw plainly it was the
      thing he meant. But still he kept himself muffled up, just as he did
      before. Not so snug, thought I, my friend, I shall have you yet! It's a
      fine evening, Sir, says I; but he took no notice; so then I came more to
      the point; Sir, says I, I think, I have had the pleasure of seeing you,
      though I quite forget where. Still he made no answer; if you have no
      objection, Sir, says I, I shall be glad to ride with you, for the night's
      coming on, and we have neither of us a servant. But then, without a word
      speaking, he rode on the quicker. However, I jogged by his side, as fast
      as he, and said, Pray Sir, did you know anything of that company you were
      looking at so hard just now? And at this he could hold out no longer; he
      turned to me in a most fierce passion, and said Pray, Sir, don't be
      troublesome. And then he got off; for when I found by his voice who he
      was, I let him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, who could bear to hear no more, again hastened Mrs Charlton, who
      now moved, on; but Morrice, stepping between them both and the door, said,
      &ldquo;Now do pray, Miss Beverley, guess who it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed, I cannot,&rdquo; said she, in the utmost confusion, &ldquo;Nor have I any
      time to hear. Come, dear madam, we shall be very late indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O but I must tell you before you go;&mdash;why it was young Mr Delvile!
      the same that I saw with you one night at the Pantheon, and that I used to
      meet last spring at Mr Harrel's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Delvile!&rdquo; repeated every one; &ldquo;very strange he should not speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, ma'am,&rdquo; continued Morrice, &ldquo;is it not the same gentleman that was
      at Mr Biddulph's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, half dead with shame and vexation, stammered out &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;I
      believe not,&mdash;I can't tell;&mdash;I have not a moment to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, at last, got Mrs Charlton out of the room, and into the chaise.
      But thither, before she could drive off, she was followed by Mr Gosport,
      who gravely came to offer his advice that she would immediately lodge an
      information at the Public Office at Bow Street, that a very suspicious
      looking man had been observed loitering in those parts, who appeared to
      harbour most dangerous designs against her person and property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was too much confounded to rally or reply, and Mr Gosport returned
      to his party with his speech unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the journey was without any new casualty, for late as it was,
      they escaped being robbed; but neither robbers nor new casualties were
      wanting to make it unpleasant to Cecilia; the incidents which had already
      happened sufficed for that purpose; and the consciousness of being so
      generally betrayed, added to the delay of her recantation, prepared her
      for nothing but mortifications to herself, and conflicts with Delvile the
      most bitter and severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near ten o'clock before they arrived in Pall-Mall. The house to
      which Delvile had given directions was easily found, and the servant sent
      forward had prepared the people of it for their reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cruellest anxiety and trepidation, Cecilia then counted every
      moment till Delvile came. She planned an apology for her conduct with all
      the address of which she was mistress, and determined to bear his
      disappointment and indignation with firmness; yet the part she had to act
      was both hard and artificial; she sighed to have it over, and repined she
      must have it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant there was a knock at the door, she flew out upon the stairs to
      listen; and hearing his well-known voice enquiring for the ladies who had
      just taken the lodgings, she ran back to Mrs Charlton, saying, &ldquo;Ah, madam,
      assist me I entreat! for now must I merit, or forfeit your esteem for
      ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you pardon,&rdquo; cried Delvile, as he entered the room, &ldquo;an intrusion
      which was not in <i>our bond?</i> But how could I wait till to-morrow,
      when I knew you were in town to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then made his compliments to Mrs Charlton, and, after enquiring how she
      had borne her journey, turned again to Cecilia, whose uneasy sensations he
      saw but too plainly in her countenance; &ldquo;Are you angry,&rdquo; cried he,
      anxiously, &ldquo;that I have ventured to come hither to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered she, struggling with all her feelings for composure; &ldquo;what
      we wish is easily excused; and I am glad to see you to-night, because
      otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated; and Delvile, little imagining why, thanked her in the
      warmest terms for her condescension. He then related how he had been
      tormented by Morrice, enquired why Mr Monckton had not accompanied her,
      and what could possibly have induced her to make her journey so late, or,
      with so large a party, to be walking upon the high road instead of
      hastening to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder not,&rdquo; answered she, more steadily, &ldquo;at your surprise, though I
      have now no time to lessen it. You have never, I find, received my
      letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried he, much struck by her manner; &ldquo;was it to forbid our meeting
      till to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; she repeated expressively, &ldquo;no; it was to forbid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the door was suddenly opened, and Morrice burst into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismay and astonishment of Delvile at sight of him could only be
      equalled by the confusion and consternation of Cecilia; but Morrice,
      perceiving neither, abruptly called out &ldquo;Miss Beverley, I quite beg your
      pardon for coming so late, but you must know&rdquo;&mdash;then stopping short
      upon seeing Delvile, &ldquo;Good lord,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;if here is not our <i>gentleman
      spy!</i> Why, Sir, you have not spared the spur! I left you galloping off
      quite another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be Sir,&rdquo; cried Delvile, equally enraged at the
      interruption and the observation, &ldquo;you did not, I presume, wait upon Miss
      Beverley to talk of <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; answered he, lightly, &ldquo;for I had told her all about you at the
      inn. Did not I, Miss Beverley? Did not I tell you I was sure it was Mr
      Delvile that was dodging us about so? Though I believe, Sir, you thought I
      had not found you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, young man,&rdquo; said Mrs Charlton, much offended by this familiar
      intrusion, &ldquo;how did you find <i>us</i> out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma'am, by the luckiest accident in the world! Just as I was riding
      into town, I met the returned chaise that brought you; and I knew the
      postilion very well, as I go that road pretty often; so, by the merest
      chance in the world, I saw him by the light of the moon. And then he told
      me where he had set you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Sir,&rdquo; again asked Mrs Charlton, &ldquo;what was your reason for
      making the enquiry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma'am, I had a little favour to ask of Miss Beverley, that made me
      think I would take the liberty to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was this time of night, Sir,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;the only one you could
      chase for that purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma'am, I'll tell you how that was; I did not mean to have called
      till to-morrow morning; but as I was willing to know if the postilion had
      given me a right direction, I knocked one soft little knock at the door,
      thinking you might be gone to bed after your journey, merely to ask if it
      was the right house; but when the servant told me there was a gentleman
      with you already, I thought there would be no harm in just stepping for a
      moment up stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, Sir,&rdquo; said Cecilia, whom mingled shame and vexation had
      hitherto kept silent, &ldquo;is your business with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma'am, I only just called to give you a direction to a most
      excellent dog-doctor, as we call him, that lives at the corner of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dog-doctor, Sir?&rdquo; repeated Cecilia, &ldquo;and what have I to do with any
      such direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you must know, ma'am, I have been in the greatest concern imaginable
      about that accident which happened to me with the poor little dog, and so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What little dog, Sir?&rdquo; cried Delvile, who now began to conclude he was
      not sober, &ldquo;do you know what you are talking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir, for it was that very little dog you made me drop out of my
      arms, by which means he broke his other leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> made you drop him?&rdquo; cried Delvile, angrily, &ldquo;I believe, Sir, you
      had much better call some other time; it does not appear to me that you
      are in a proper situation for remaining here at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I shall be gone in an instant,&rdquo; answered Morrice, &ldquo;I merely wanted
      to beg the favour of Miss Beverley to tell that young lady that owned the
      dog, that if she will carry him to this man, I am sure he will make a cure
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sir,&rdquo; said Delvile, convinced now of his inebriety, &ldquo;if you please
      we will walk away together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to take <i>you</i> away, Sir,&rdquo; said Morrice, looking very
      significantly, &ldquo;for I suppose you have not rode so hard to go so soon; but
      as to me, I'll only write the direction, and be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delvile, amazed and irritated at so many following specimens of ignorant
      assurance, would not, in his present eagerness, have scrupled turning him
      out of the house, had he not thought it imprudent, upon such an occasion,
      to quarrel with him, and improper, at so late an hour, to be left behind;
      he therefore only, while he was writing the direction, told Cecilia, in a
      low voice, that he would get rid of him and return in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then went together; leaving Cecilia in an agony of distress
      surpassing all she had hitherto experienced. &ldquo;Ah, Mrs Charlton,&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;what refuge have I now from ridicule, or perhaps disgrace! Mr
      Delvile has been detected watching me in disguise! he has been discovered
      at this late hour meeting me in private! The story will reach his family
      with all the hyperbole of exaggeration;&mdash;how will his noble mother
      disdain me! how cruelly shall I sink before the severity of her eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Charlton tried to comfort her, but the effort was vain, and she spent
      her time in the bitterest repining till eleven o'clock. Delvile's not
      returning then added wonder to her sadness, and the impropriety of his
      returning at all so late, grew every instant more glaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, though in great disturbance, and evidently much ruffled in his
      temper, he came; &ldquo;I feared,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I had passed the time for
      admittance, and the torture I have suffered from being detained has almost
      driven me wild. I have been in misery to see you again,&mdash;your looks,
      your manner,&mdash;the letter you talk of,&mdash;all have filled me with
      alarm; and though I know not what it is I have to dread, I find it
      impossible to rest a moment without some explanation. Tell me, then, why
      you seem thus strange and thus depressed? Tell me what that letter was to
      forbid? Tell me any thing, and every thing, but that you repent your
      condescension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That letter,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;would have explained to you all. I scarce
      know how to communicate its contents; yet I hope you will hear with
      patience what I acknowledge I have resolved upon only from necessity. That
      letter was to tell you that to-morrow we must not meet;&mdash;it was to
      prepare you, indeed, for our meeting, perhaps, never more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed he, starting, &ldquo;what is it you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I have made a promise too rash to be kept; that you must pardon me
      if, late as it is, I retract, since I am convinced it was wrong, and must
      be wretched in performing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confounded and dismayed, for a moment he continued silent, and then
      passionately called out, &ldquo;Who has been with you to defame me in your
      opinion? Who has barbarously wronged my character since I left you Monday?
      Mr Monckton received me coldly,&mdash;has he injured me in your esteem?
      Tell, tell me but to whom I owe this change, that my vindication, if it
      restores not your favour, may at least make you cease to (missing words)
      that once I was honoured with some share of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wants not to be restored,&rdquo; said Cecilia, with much softness, &ldquo;since it
      has never been alienated. Be satisfied that I think of you as I thought
      when we last parted, and generously forbear to reproach me, when I assure
      you I am actuated by principles which you ought not to disapprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you then, unchanged?&rdquo; cried he, more gently, &ldquo;and is your esteem
      for me still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it justice to say so once,&rdquo; cried she, hastily interrupting
      him, &ldquo;but exact from me nothing more. It is too late for us now to talk
      any longer; to-morrow you may find my letter at Mrs Robert's, and that,
      short as it is, contains my resolution and its cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; cried he vehemently, &ldquo;can I quit you without knowing it! I would
      not linger till to-morrow in this suspence to be master of the universe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told it you, Sir, already; whatever is clandestine carries a
      consciousness of evil, and so repugnant do I find it to my disposition and
      opinions, that till you give me back the promise I so unworthily made, I
      must be a stranger to peace, because at war with my own actions and
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recover, then, your peace,&rdquo; cried Delvile with much emotion, &ldquo;for I here
      acquit you of all promise!&mdash;to fetter, to compel you, were too
      inhuman to afford me any happiness. Yet hear me, dispassionately hear me,
      and deliberate a moment before you resolve upon my exile. Your scruples I
      am not now going to combat, I grieve that they are so powerful, but I have
      no new arguments with which to oppose them; all I have to say, is, that it
      is now too late for a retreat to satisfy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Sir, and far too true! yet is it always best to do right, however
      tardily; always better to repent, than to grow callous in wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffer not, however, your delicacy for my family to make you forget what
      is due to yourself as well as to me; the fear of shocking you led me just
      now to conceal what a greater fear now urges me to mention. The honour I
      have had in view is already known to many, and in a very short time there
      are none will be ignorant of it. That impudent young man, Morrice, had the
      effrontery to rally me upon my passion for you, and though I reproved him
      with great asperity, he followed me into a coffee-house, whither I went
      merely to avoid him. There I forced myself to stay, till I saw him engaged
      with a news-paper, and then, through various private streets and alleys, I
      returned hither; but judge my indignation, when the moment I knocked at
      the door, I perceived him again at my side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he, then, see you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I angrily demanded what he meant by thus pursuing me; he very
      submissively begged my pardon, and said he had had a notion I should come
      back, and had therefore only followed, me to see if he was right! I
      hesitated for an instant whether to chastise, or confide in him; but
      believing a few hours would make his impertinence immaterial, I did
      neither,&mdash;the door opened, and I came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopt; but Cecilia was too much shocked to answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;weigh your objections against the consequences
      which must follow. It is discovered I attended you in town; it will be
      presumed I had your permission for such attendance; to separate,
      therefore, now, will be to no purpose with respect to that delicacy which
      makes you wish it. It will be food for conjecture, for enquiry, for
      wonder, almost while both our names are remembered, and while to me it
      will bring the keenest misery in the severity of my disappointment, it
      will cast over your own conduct a veil of mystery and obscurity wholly
      subversive of that unclouded openness, that fair, transparent
      ingenuousness, by which it has hitherto been distinguished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how dreadfully have I erred, that whatever path I
      now take must lead me wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overwhelm me with grief,&rdquo; cried Delvile, &ldquo;by finding you thus
      distressed, when I had hoped&mdash;Oh cruel Cecilia! how different to this
      did I hope to have met you!&mdash;all your doubts settled, all your fears
      removed, your mind perfectly composed, and ready, unreluctantly, to ratify
      the promise with so much sweetness accorded me!&mdash;where now are those
      hopes!&mdash;where now.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will you not begone?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, uneasily, &ldquo;indeed it is too late
      to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; cried he, with great energy, &ldquo;and let good Mrs Charlton
      speak too,&mdash;ought not every objection to our union, however potent,
      to give way, without further hesitation, to the certainty that our
      intending it must become public? Who that hears of our meeting in London,
      at such a season, in such circumstances, and at such hours,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, angrily, &ldquo;do you mention them, and yet stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> speak now,&rdquo; answered he with quickness, &ldquo;or lose forever
      all that is dear to me, and add to the misery of that loss, the
      heart-piercing reflection of having injured her whom of all the world I
      most love, most value, and most revere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how injured?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, half alarmed and half displeased;
      &ldquo;Surely I must strangely have lived to fear now the voice of calumny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any one has ever,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;so lived as to dare defy it, Miss
      Beverley is she; but though safe by the established purity of your
      character from calumny, there are other, and scarce less invidious
      attacks, from which no one is exempt, and of which the refinement, the
      sensibility of your mind, will render you but the more susceptible;
      ridicule has shafts, and impertinence has arrows, which though against
      innocence they may be levelled in vain, have always the power of wounding
      tranquility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Struck with a truth which she could not controvert, Cecilia sighed deeply,
      but spoke not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Delvile is right,&rdquo; said Mrs Charlton, &ldquo;and though your plan, my dear
      Cecilia, was certainly virtuous and proper, when you set out from Bury,
      the purpose of your journey must now be made so public, that it will no
      longer be judicious nor rational.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delvile poured forth his warmest thanks for this friendly interposition,
      and then, strengthened by such an advocate, re-urged all his arguments
      with redoubled hope and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, disturbed, uncertain, comfortless, could frame her mind to no
      resolution; she walked about the room, deliberated,&mdash;determined,&mdash;wavered
      and deliberated again. Delvile then grew more urgent, and represented so
      strongly the various mortifications which must follow so tardy a
      renunciation of their intentions, that, terrified and perplexed, and
      fearing the breach of their union would now be more injurious to her than
      its ratification, she ceased all opposition to his arguments, and uttered
      no words but of solicitation that he would leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I will begone this very moment. Tell me but first you
      will think of what I have said, and refer me not to your letter, but deign
      yourself to pronounce my doom, when you have considered if it may not be
      softened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this she tacitly consented; and elated with fresh rising hope, he
      recommended his cause to the patronage of Mrs Charlton, and then, taking
      leave of Cecilia, &ldquo;I go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though I have yet a thousand things to
      propose and to supplicate, and though still in a suspense that my temper
      knows ill how to endure; but I should rather be rendered miserable than
      happy, in merely overpowering your reason by entreaty. I leave you,
      therefore, to your own reflections; yet remember,&mdash;and refuse not to
      remember with some compunction, that all chance, all possibility of
      earthly happiness for <i>me</i> depends upon your decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then tore himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, shocked at the fatigue she had occasioned her good old friend,
      now compelled her to go to rest, and dedicated the remaining part of the
      night to uninterrupted deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed once more in her power to be mistress of her destiny; but the
      very liberty of choice she had so much coveted, now attained, appeared the
      most heavy of calamities; since, uncertain even what she ought to do, she
      rather wished to be drawn than to lead, rather desired to be guided than
      to guide. She was to be responsible not only to the world but to herself
      for the whole of this momentous transaction, and the terror of leaving
      either dissatisfied, made independence burthensome, and unlimited power a
      grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiness or misery which awaited her resolution were but secondary
      considerations in the present state of her mind; her consent to a
      clandestine action she lamented as an eternal blot to her character, and
      the undoubted publication of that consent as equally injurious to her
      fame. Neither retracting nor fulfilling her engagement could now retrieve
      what was past, and in the bitterness of regret for the error she had
      committed she thought happiness unattainable for the remainder of her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this gloomy despondence passed the night, her eyes never closed, her
      determination never formed. Morning, however, came, and upon something to
      fix was indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now, therefore, finally employed herself in briefly, comparing the
      good with the evil of giving Delvile wholly up, or becoming his for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accepting him, she was exposed to all the displeasure of his relations,
      and, which affected her most, to the indignant severity of his mother; but
      not another obstacle could be found that seemed of any weight to oppose
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In refusing him she was liable to the derision of the world, to sneers
      from strangers, and remonstrances from her friends, to becoming a topic
      for ridicule, if not for slander, and an object of curiosity if not of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ills, therefore, that threatened her marriage, though most afflicting,
      were least disgraceful, and those which awaited its breach, if less
      serious, were more mortifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after weighing every circumstance as well as her perturbed
      spirits would permit, she concluded that so late to reject him must bring
      misery without any alleviation, while accepting him, though followed by
      wrath and reproach, left some opening for future hope, and some prospect
      of better days.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fulfil, therefore, her engagement was her final resolution.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur; (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit;  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility;

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
